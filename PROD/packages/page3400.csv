Implementing client side localization into any web application is always challenge. Most of web technologies provide localization using server-side technologies. For e.g. .Net application uses Resources Files(.resx) to implement localization into globalize application. 

Nowadays world is extensively moving towards Asynchronous development models like AJAX / SPA. Several frameworks, libraries are already available on the web. To access these server side resources requires custom REST services / handlers to be additionally implemented into the host application. 

This plugin makes life easier where you can manage all your localized resources into plain Text or JavaScript file. Based on current culture provided to this plugin, it loads associated resource entries for use. To enhance performance it uses Cache mechanication for subsequent Initialization calls.
