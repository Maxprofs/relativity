These tools are highly flexible, allowing many options for locating and manipulating elements within a browser, and one of its key features is the support for automating multiple browser platforms. This package contains the .NET bindings for the older, more procedural Selenium Remote Control (or Selenium RC) API, but implemented using the newer WebDriver technology. It does not require a running instance of the Selenium Server, and is not limited to the functionality available from within the JavaScript sandbox.
