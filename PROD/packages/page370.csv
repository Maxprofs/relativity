To use your own custom System.Security.Cryptography.HMAC-derived implementation, you simply register your type with the application domain (for example: via the CryptoConfig class) and you will be able to provide it's identifier string to the constructor when initializing an instance of System.Security.Cryptography.PBKDF2.

A robust configuration implementation is also included via the System.Configuration.PBKDF2Section class. With this configuration section, you can specify a default iteration count, a default HMAC algorithm and a default salt size. When any of these values are not specified during initialization, the configured defaults are used. Upon installation of the package, the following configuration defaults will be assigned:

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers.

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.",MimeKit,False,2018-04-14T17:17:00.29+00:00,True,False,"An Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME, S/MIME and PGP messages on desktop and mobile platforms.","mime,security,smime,openpgp,pgp,mbox,email,parser,xamarin,android,ios",2617261,False,0.17.0

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol.

The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://yuicompressor.codeplex.com).",WebMarkupMin.Core,False,2017-05-07T11:37:49.133-07:00,True,False,"The Web Markup Minifier (abbreviated WebMarkupMin) is a .NET library that contains a set of markup minifiers.

There are 3 layers of security to prevent abuse. 

1. The API signs the remote url with HMAC SHA-256 to prevent anyone from tampering or generating them without access to the signing key.
2. A whitelist approach is taken to sites. By default, no sites are allowed. You must handle the RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.AllowRemoteRequest event to permit sites (or portions of sites) to be relayed.
4. The  plugin requires that all remote images be decoded and re-encoded. Files are never returned as-is. This ensures that the files are valid images, and prevents XSS attacks.

Please note, you must configure the <remotereader signingKey=""to a long and secure pass phrase"" /> and set <remotereader allowAllSignedRequests=""true"" /> if all code calling RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.CreateSignedUrl(remoteUrl,settings) is trusted.

Docs: http://imageresizing.net/

Support: http://imageresizing.net/support

Works with .NET 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, ASP.NET WebForms, MVC 1-4, WebAPI, Routing, IIS 5, 5.1, 6, 7, 7.5, & 8 and nearly all CMSes.

Use ether the URL API: image.jpg?width=100&height=100 *or* the Managed API: ImageBuilder.Current.Build(source,dest,settings).

ImageResizer provides incredible quality and highly-optimized image processing - by default. Don't leak memory by using System.Drawing directly or create horrible previews with GetThumbnailImage. Add the ImageResizer.Plugins.DiskCache package to serve dynamic images as fast as static ones. 

With this library, you can create beautiful image galleries, product thumbnails, and fast, scalable websites *without* sacrificing agility or responsive web design.

## Functionality in this package

The ImageResizer core package lets you: 

1. Decode jpeg, png, gif, tiff, and bmp files from uploads, streams, byte arrays, and files. 

2. Pre-rotate or flip (based on gravity sensor OR manual angle).

3. Apply manual cropping in either source or screen coordinates.

4. Efficiently apply width and/or height constraints, using any of several constraint modes: max, pad, crop, or stretch. Provides the highest quality image resampling (bicubic 2-pass) available on the windows platform.

5. Rotate, flip, add borders, padding, margins, with custom colors.

3. Re-compress into jpeg (with adjustable compression) or lossless png form -  as a byte array, stream, or file.

All through a REST API and Managed API with a symmetrical command set. 

URL rewriting, custom authorization, 404 fallbacks, gradient generation, exif stripping, size limiting, and cache-control customization are also included in the core DLL.
