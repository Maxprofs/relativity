DevForce fills this gap so you don't have to. Instead of building, maintaining, revising, and defending your application's infrastructure; you can focus on what you do best-application development.

DevForce implements end-to-end n-tier architecture by exposing a generic web service on the server that takes a LINQ expression and returns business objects to the client over the internet.

Write LINQ queries on the client and get back business objects with your own custom business logic-just like working with a 2-tier or client-server application.
