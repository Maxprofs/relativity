ipavlu,2017-12-30T06:29:45.803Z,33,111,"1) Unified Concurrency
    The main mission is to unify usage of heterogeneous synchronization primitives with interface/pattern based Object Oriented approach. Switching between multiple synchronization primitives with one code line change! Agile Development ready solution to synchronization. Easy upgrade from general threading to async/await thanks to the pattern based design! Reduced code complexity. Easy correctness testing. Simplified performance optimization. Currently implemented synchronization primitives cover:

    - wrapper for the .Net SpinLock,
    - TicketSpinLock,
    - Lock replacement of C# lock (Monitor),
    - wrapper around C# lock (monitor) benchmarking only,
    - async/await AsyncLock,
    - async/await AsyncSpinLock,
    - async/await AsyncTicketSpinLock.

    2) AsyncTesting SequencerUC
    A strongly typed Sequencer is a powerful threading or async/await based unit testing tool to simplify and test correctness in asynchronous and/or parallel code.

    The main mission is to unify usage of heterogeneous synchronization primitives with interface/pattern based Object Oriented approach. Switching between multiple synchronization primitives with one code line change! Agile Development ready solution to synchronization. Easy upgrade from general threading to async/await thanks to the pattern based design! Reduced code complexity. Easy correctness testing. Simplified performance optimization. Currently implemented synchronization primitives cover:

    - wrapper for the .Net SpinLock,
    - TicketSpinLock,
    - Lock replacement of C# lock (Monitor),
    - wrapper around C# lock (monitor) benchmarking only,
    - async/await AsyncLock,
    - async/await AsyncSpinLock,
    - async/await AsyncTicketSpinLock.
