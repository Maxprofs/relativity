      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.

Paul Louth,2015-10-04T23:10:36.437Z,864,929,"This library uses and abuses the features of C# 6 to provide a functional 'Base class library', that, if you squint, can look like extensions to the language itself. It also includes an 'Erlang like' process system (actors) that can optionally persist messages and state to Redis (note you can use it without Redis for in-app messaging). The process system additionally supports Rx streams of messages and state allowing for a fully complete system of reactive events and message dispatch.

This package is a functional 'toolkit' and also solves some of the annoyances with C#, namely:

            * Poor tuple support
            * Null reference problem
            * Lack of lambda and expression inference
            * Void isn't a real type
            * Mutable lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, etc.
            * The awful 'out' parameter

        The library very heavily focusses on correctness, to give you the tools needed to write safe declarative code.

        Features:

            Powerful 'prelude' which you include by `using static LanguageExt.Prelude` (in C# 6) that covers many of the basic functional language core library functions and types (from `using LanguageExt`):

                Pattern matching
                Lambda type-inference: `var fn = fun( (int x, int y) => x + y );`
                `Option<T>` monad
                `OptionUnsafe<T>` monad
                `Either<L,R>` monad
                `EitherUnsafe<L,R>` monad
                `TryOption<T>` monad

                `Reader<E, T>` monad
                `State<S, T>` monad
                `Tuple(a,b,...)` - `Tuple` construction without typing `Tuple.Create(a,b,...)` as well as `map` to project the `Item1..ItemN` properties onto named values.
                `Lst<T>` - immutable list 
                `Map<K,V>` - immutable map

AD allows exact and efficient calculation of derivatives, by systematically invoking the chain rule of calculus at the elementary operator level during program execution. AD is different from numerical differentiation, which is prone to truncation and round-off errors, and symbolic differentiation, which is affected by expression swell and cannot fully handle algorithmic control flow.

Using the DiffSharp library, derivative calculations (gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, directional derivatives, and matrix-free Hessian- and Jacobian-vector products) can be incorporated with minimal change into existing algorithms. Diffsharp supports nested forward and reverse AD up to any level, meaning that you can compute exact higher-order derivatives or differentiate functions that are internally making use of differentiation. Please see the API Overview page for a list of available operations.

The library is under active development by Atılım Güneş Baydin and Barak A. Pearlmutter mainly for research applications in machine learning, as part of their work at the Brain and Computation Lab, Hamilton Institute, National University of Ireland Maynooth.

Paul Louth,2015-10-04T21:26:17.457Z,864,929,"This library uses and abuses the features of C# 6 to provide a functional 'Base class library', that, if you squint, can look like extensions to the language itself. It also includes an 'Erlang like' process system (actors) that can optionally persist messages and state to Redis (note you can use it without Redis for in-app messaging). The process system additionally supports Rx streams of messages and state allowing for a fully complete system of reactive events and message dispatch.

This package is a functional 'toolkit' and also solves some of the annoyances with C#, namely:

            * Poor tuple support
            * Null reference problem
            * Lack of lambda and expression inference
            * Void isn't a real type
            * Mutable lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, etc.
            * The awful 'out' parameter

        The library very heavily focusses on correctness, to give you the tools needed to write safe declarative code.

        Features:

            Powerful 'prelude' which you include by `using static LanguageExt.Prelude` (in C# 6) that covers many of the basic functional language core library functions and types (from `using LanguageExt`):

                Pattern matching
                Lambda type-inference: `var fn = fun( (int x, int y) => x + y );`
                `Option<T>` monad
                `OptionUnsafe<T>` monad
                `Either<L,R>` monad
                `EitherUnsafe<L,R>` monad

                `Tuple(a,b,...)` - `Tuple` construction without typing `Tuple.Create(a,b,...)` as well as `map` to project the `Item1..ItemN` properties onto named values.
                `Lst<T>` - immutable list 
                `Map<K,V>` - immutable map

      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
      - Xamarin.iOS
      - Xamarin.Forms
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The MVVM framework includes the following features that differs this project from other frameworks:
      - Deep integration with each platform.
      - Supports state preservation and restoration for mobile platforms.
      - Full Fragment support for Android, you do not need to worry about activity, fragments, sub-fragments or their state all this makes the framework.
      - Solves the nested user controls problem in MVVM, all view models are dynamically created by you, using the GetViewModel method and you do not need to use the ViewModelLocator.
      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc.
      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.
      - Binding parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.

      - Supports all kinds of navigation like modal window, page navigation, tab navigation, back stack fragment navigation for android. You can also easily add a new kind of navigation.
      - Navigation system works with view models and allows to expect the completion of the operation. You can pass any parameters between view models.
      - Good design mode support, for xaml platforms supports the creation of design view model with any constructor parameters.
      - Supports bindings on all platforms, all of the native binding features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more.

      - Supports subscription to any control event.
      - Built-in support for validation.
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings.
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings.

Paul Louth,2015-10-04T21:08:05.82Z,864,929,"This library uses and abuses the features of C# 6 to provide a functional 'Base class library', that, if you squint, can look like extensions to the language itself. It also includes an 'Erlang like' process system (actors) that can optionally persist messages and state to Redis (note you can use it without Redis for in-app messaging). The process system additionally supports Rx streams of messages and state allowing for a fully complete system of reactive events and message dispatch.

This package is a functional 'toolkit' and also solves some of the annoyances with C#, namely:

            * Poor tuple support
            * Null reference problem
            * Lack of lambda and expression inference
            * Void isn't a real type
            * Mutable lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, etc.
            * The awful 'out' parameter

        The library very heavily focusses on correctness, to give you the tools needed to write safe declarative code.

        Features:

            Powerful 'prelude' which you include by `using static LanguageExt.Prelude` (in C# 6) that covers many of the basic functional language core library functions and types (from `using LanguageExt`):

                Pattern matching
                Lambda type-inference: `var fn = fun( (int x, int y) => x + y );`
                `Option<T>` monad
                `OptionUnsafe<T>` monad
                `Either<L,R>` monad
                `EitherUnsafe<L,R>` monad
                `TryOption<T>` monad

                `Reader<E, T>` monad
                `State<S, T>` monad
                `Tuple(a,b,...)` - `Tuple` construction without typing `Tuple.Create(a,b,...)` as well as `map` to project the `Item1..ItemN` properties onto named values.
                `Lst<T>` - immutable list
