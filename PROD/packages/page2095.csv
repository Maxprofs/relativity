DawgSharp is an open-source C# implementation featuring a linear time graph reduction algorithm and out-of-the-box persistence support. 

The two main objects in the library are Dawg and DawgBuilder. Dawg is immutable, you must use DawgBuilder to build a Dawg and then save it to a stream. Then use Dawg.Load to rehydrate the data. Once reloaded, Dawg re-emerges as a completely different data structure (but, oddly, the same class) that is nearly as fast as a HashSet for lookups and is much, much more memory-efficient (factors of 30x - 40x are not uncommon). Please note that the Save/Load step is necessary to get the full potential out of the Dawg object. Use a MemoryStream if disk interaction is not desired.

The Dawg class can be thought of as a read-only Dictionary <string, Value> type. It has the [""""] indexer and implements IEnumerable <KeyValuePair <string, Value>>. 

One other very useful feature of Dawg (not found in Dictionary) is the ability to quickly find all words that start with a particular substring: dawg.MatchPrefix (""star"") could possibly yield ""star"", ""starch"", ""start"", ""starting"", etc.
