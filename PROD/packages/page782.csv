Semih Okur,2015-02-14T23:14:02.72Z,67,1161,"AsyncFixer helps developers in finding and removing 3 common async/await misuses (anti-patterns). AsyncFixer was tested with hundreds of C# apps and successfully handles many corner cases. 

If you want AsyncFixer to work as an analyzer on every project you open in Visual Studio, please download the extension: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/03448836-db42-46b3-a5c7-5fc5d36a8308

Here are 3 misuses that AsyncFixer detects:

1) Unnecessary async/await Methods

There are some async methods where there is no need to use async/await. It is important to detect this kind of misuse because adding the async modifier comes at a price.

AsyncFixer removes async/await keywords from these methods. 


2) Using Long-running Operations under Async Methods

Developers use some potentially long running or blocking operations under async methods even though there are corresponding asynchronous versions of these methods in .NET or third-party libraries. Some example for such operations: Task.Wait(), Task.Result, Task.WaitAll(...), StreamReader.ReadToEnd(...), Thread.Sleep(...),  etc. 

AsyncFixer automatically replaces these operations with their corresponding asynchronous operations and inserts 'await' expression. For instance, it converts Thread.Sleep(...) to await Task.Delay(...).


3) Fire & Forget Methods

Some async methods are 'fire&forget', which return void. Unless a method is only called as an event handler, it must be awaitable. Otherwise, it is a code smell because it complicates control flow and makes error detection & correction difficult. 

AsyncFixer replaces the return type of the (non-event handler) method with 'Task'.


*** Important ***

The detection and fixing of more async/await misuses are being implemented.
Please send your bug report or feedback to semih.okur@gmail.com

Semih Okur,2015-02-14T23:14:02.72Z,67,1161,"AsyncFixer helps developers in finding and correcting 3 common async/await misuses (anti-patterns). AsyncFixer was tested with hundreds of C# apps and successfully handles many corner cases. 

AsyncFixer (the nuget package) will work as a project-local analyzer that participates in builds. Attaching an analyzer to a project means that the analyzer travels with the project to source control and so it's easy to apply the same rule for the team. It also means that commandline builds report the issues reported by the analyzer.

If you want AsyncFixer to work just in the IDE and to work as an analyzer on every project you open in Visual Studio, please download the VSIX extension instead of this nuget package from here: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/03448836-db42-46b3-a5c7-5fc5d36a8308

Here are 3 misuses that AsyncFixer detects:

1) Unnecessary async/await Methods

There are some async methods where there is no need to use async/await. It is important to detect this kind of misuse because adding the async modifier comes at a price.

AsyncFixer removes async/await keywords from these methods. 


2) Using Long-running Operations under Async Methods

Developers use some potentially long running or blocking operations under async methods even though there are corresponding asynchronous versions of these methods in .NET or third-party libraries. Some example for such operations: Task.Wait(), Task.Result, Task.WaitAll(...), StreamReader.ReadToEnd(...), Thread.Sleep(...),  etc. 

AsyncFixer automatically replaces these operations with their corresponding asynchronous operations and inserts 'await' expression. For instance, it converts Thread.Sleep(...) to await Task.Delay(...).


3) Fire & Forget Methods

Some async methods are 'fire&forget', which return void. Unless a method is only called as an event handler, it must be awaitable. Otherwise, it is a code smell because it complicates control flow and makes error detection & correction difficult. 

AsyncFixer replaces the return type of the (non-event handler) method with 'Task'.

4) Decide the use of ConfigureAwait(false)

AsyncFixer checks whether the method and its call graph will ever need the UI or Request (ASP.NET) context at all. AsyncFixer decides the need for ConfigureAwait(false) in the await statement(s) in the method body.

It's coming soon!

*** Important ***

The detection and fixing of more async/await misuses are being implemented.

Semih Okur,2015-02-14T23:14:02.72Z,67,1161,"AsyncFixer helps developers in finding and removing 3 common async/await misuses (anti-patterns). AsyncFixer was tested with hundreds of C# apps and successfully handles many corner cases. 

If you want AsyncFixer to work as an analyzer on every project you open in Visual Studio, please download the extension: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/03448836-db42-46b3-a5c7-5fc5d36a8308

Here are 3 misuses that AsyncFixer detects:

1) Unnecessary async/await Methods

There are some async methods where there is no need to use async/await. It is important to detect this kind of misuse because adding the async modifier comes at a price.

AsyncFixer removes async/await keywords from these methods. 


2) Using Long-running Operations under Async Methods

Developers use some potentially long running or blocking operations under async methods even though there are corresponding asynchronous versions of these methods in .NET or third-party libraries. Some example for such operations: Task.Wait(), Task.Result, Task.WaitAll(...), StreamReader.ReadToEnd(...), Thread.Sleep(...),  etc. 

AsyncFixer automatically replaces these operations with their corresponding asynchronous operations and inserts 'await' expression. For instance, it converts Thread.Sleep(...) to await Task.Delay(...).


3) Fire & Forget Methods

Some async methods are 'fire&forget', which return void. Unless a method is only called as an event handler, it must be awaitable. Otherwise, it is a code smell because it complicates control flow and makes error detection & correction difficult. 

AsyncFixer replaces the return type of the (non-event handler) method with 'Task'.


*** Important ***

The detection and fixing of more async/await misuses are being implemented.
Please send your bug report or feedback to semih.okur@gmail.com
