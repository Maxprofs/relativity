Val Melamed,2015-03-03T07:19:15.02Z,29,1144,"Features:
* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

Microsoft,2015-03-01T22:52:01.797Z,1146,1146,"  The Lumia SensorCore SDK is a collection of APIs that utilize data from different sensors, for example, the accelerometer and the GPS. SensorCore APIs can be used to track a user's physical activities and motion. The sensors run constantly in the background, collecting and preserving data for up to the past ten days. Even though the sensors are constantly active, they run in a low power mode, consuming only a negligible amount of battery. Since the sensors provide access to users' private data, data privacy is a critical part of the design. The user has options for controlling SensorCore SDK sensors and collected data through the motion data settings application.

The following features are included in Lumia SensorCore SDK 1.1 Preview:
•Step Counter - Counts the user's walking and running steps.
•Activity Monitor - Determines the current type of motion of the phone and the user.
•Place Monitor - Identifies the user's home, work, and visited places.
•Track Point Monitor - Records location points along the route the user has taken.
•Triggers - For background tasks, for example, for recognizing changes in the step count, or if the user has changed essential settings (location or motion data) in the phone.

Key characteristics of SensorCore SDK
•Power and memory efficient
•Secure data storage on the phone
•Access to motion history for up to ten days

Microsoft,2015-03-01T22:52:01.797Z,1146,1146,"  The Lumia SensorCore SDK is a collection of APIs that utilize data from different sensors, for example, the accelerometer and the GPS. SensorCore APIs can be used to track a user's physical activities and motion. The sensors run constantly in the background, collecting and preserving data for up to the past ten days. Even though the sensors are constantly active, they run in a low power mode, consuming only a negligible amount of battery. Since the sensors provide access to users' private data, data privacy is a critical part of the design. The user has options for controlling SensorCore SDK sensors and collected data through the motion data settings application.

The following features are included in Lumia SensorCore SDK 1.1 Preview:
•Step Counter - Counts the user's walking and running steps.
•Activity Monitor - Determines the current type of motion of the phone and the user.
•Place Monitor - Identifies the user's home, work, and visited places.
•Track Point Monitor - Records location points along the route the user has taken.
•Triggers - For background tasks, for example, for recognizing changes in the step count, or if the user has changed essential settings (location or motion data) in the phone.

Key characteristics of SensorCore SDK
•Power and memory efficient
•Secure data storage on the phone
•Access to motion history for up to ten days

Microsoft,2015-03-01T22:52:01.797Z,1146,1146,"  The Lumia SensorCore SDK is a collection of APIs that utilize data from different sensors, for example, the accelerometer and the GPS. SensorCore APIs can be used to track a user's physical activities and motion. The sensors run constantly in the background, collecting and preserving data for up to the past ten days. Even though the sensors are constantly active, they run in a low power mode, consuming only a negligible amount of battery. Since the sensors provide access to users' private data, data privacy is a critical part of the design. The user has options for controlling SensorCore SDK sensors and collected data through the motion data settings application.

The following features are included in Lumia SensorCore SDK 1.1 Preview:
•Step Counter - Counts the user's walking and running steps.
•Activity Monitor - Determines the current type of motion of the phone and the user.
•Place Monitor - Identifies the user's home, work, and visited places.
•Track Point Monitor - Records location points along the route the user has taken.
•Triggers - For background tasks, for example, for recognizing changes in the step count, or if the user has changed essential settings (location or motion data) in the phone.

Key characteristics of SensorCore SDK
•Power and memory efficient
•Secure data storage on the phone
•Access to motion history for up to ten days

* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
