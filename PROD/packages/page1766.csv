Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-23T11:11:42.747Z,549,636,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control. Supports Android, iOS, and UWP only.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

As of 1.0.1, the VideoView.VideoSource property is of type ImageSource. This means you can set the VideoSource in the same way you would set the Image.Source property, including being able to use ImageSource.FromResource().
----------------
XAML Usage:
----------------
xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

<roxv:VideoView AutoPlay=""True"" LoopPlay=""True"" ShowController=""True"" VideoSource=""http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4"" />
----------------
In your iOS project ""AppDelegate"" code file, you must call ""Rox.VideoIos.Init()"" before ""Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init()"". It should look something like:
----------------
Rox.VideoIos.Init();

global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();

LoadApplication(new MyVideoApplication());
----------------
The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
----------------
[1.0.0]
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
----------------
[1.0.1]
 - ImageSource VideoSource { get; set; } (See Xamarin article ""Working with Images"")
----------------
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)
----------------
Common Questions:
 Q: Why is the pcl named "".Portable""?
 A: There is a .NETStandardv1.4 version ready to go, I am just waiting to see what happens with ""project.json"".

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?
 A: You can have all the profits made from this component. So, no Tim, you don't.

 Q: Would you like another coffee?
 A: Don't ask, give.
----------------
What people are saying about the VideoView control:
 - ""It is awesome"" - me

 - ""I wanna punch that rabbit in the head"" - my brother
 - ""That's nice, dear"" - my mum

 - ""But I can already watch p0rn on my phone"" - name withheld (see I didn't tell them your name, Gav)
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about, and NO! I do not want to go back to your place and make our own video, creep"" - random girl on the street
 - ""I am pretty sure this will revolutionise the IT industry"" - me
 - ""If you don't shut up I will punch YOU in the head"" - my brother
 - ""What do you mean by a zammering video? Sounds like something I can't click on at work."" - Sid
 - ""Do you have to keep playing that same stupid rabbit video over and over?"" - Tim

			## Features

			* Create your apps in PCL and run them everywhere, truly multi-platform (web included)
			* The UI is defined from code (XAML designer on the way)
			* 100% native controls are used in all platforms
			* You have only the ""common"" UI api surface among all platforms
			* Supports click, doble click and, for user input controls, value changed events
			* Using OKHOSTING.UI.CSS you can use CSS files to define the styles of your controls on all platforms (thanks to AngleSharp)

			## Supported controls

			* Autocomplete
			* Button
			* Calendar
			* CheckBox
			* HyperLink
			* Image
			* Label
			* ListPicker (equivalent to a DropDownList)
			* PasswordTextBox
			* TextArea

			## Features

			* Create your apps in PCL and run them everywhere, truly multi-platform (web included)
			* The UI is defined from code (XAML designer on the way)
			* 100% native controls are used in all platforms
			* You have only the ""common"" UI api surface among all platforms
			* Supports click, doble click and, for user input controls, value changed events
			* Using OKHOSTING.UI.CSS you can use CSS files to define the styles of your controls on all platforms (thanks to AngleSharp)

			## Supported controls

			* Autocomplete
			* Button
			* Calendar
			* CheckBox
			* HyperLink
			* Image
			* Label
			* ListPicker (equivalent to a DropDownList)
			* PasswordTextBox

- Composite primary keys are supported.
- Compatible with component model data annotations.
- Opt-in relationships.
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries.
- A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
- A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
