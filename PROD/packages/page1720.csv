Supported features:

- implicit conversions - rationals integrate seamlessly with other number types
- unlimited precision - rationals use BigInteger inside
- canonical form - each rational can have its canonical form (irreducible fraction where denominator is always positive)
- separate whole and fractional part - any rational number can be separated into a whole part (integer quotient aka result of integer division) and fractional part (reminder of the integral division aka result of modulo operation)
- comparison & equality
- multiple formatting options - ToString(""C"") (canonical form), ToString(""W"") (whole + fractional part), or normal fraction format
- continued fraction expansion - expand rational numbers to continued fraction (sequence of coefficients), construct rational numbers from sequence of continued fraction coefficients
