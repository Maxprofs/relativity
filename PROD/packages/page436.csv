It has a very simple application programming interface that allows applications to supply a path to an image or a pointer to a buffer in memory and to get in return the detected license plate number and its position in the image.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It has a very simple application programming interface that allows applications to supply a path to an image or a pointer to a buffer in memory and to get in return the detected license plate number and its position in the image.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.
