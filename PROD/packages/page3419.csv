https://github.com/michaelbradley91/StickySharedResources

Sticky Shared Resources is designed to help you manage shared memory between multiple threads. It allows you to:
* Create resources associated to C# objects
* Acquire these resources in much the same way you might ""acquire"" a semaphore.
* Connect resources together. If you acquire a resource, this package ensures you will also acquire all resources it is connected to.
* Disconnect resources so threads can pick them up independently again.
This package helps you to manipulate these resources in parallel through ""resource groups"". You create a resource group and ask it to be populated with all the resources you need. You then manipulate these resources and, once you're done, you free the resource group, which frees the resources for other threads.
Do not create multiple resource groups in the same thread! For the least painful experience, stick to one concurrency control mechanism (monitors / semaphores / resource groups). If you've got that, you're set! 

This package is a stepping stone for a more friendly way to manage shared memory between threads - through pipes.",StickySharedResources,False,2016-01-02T22:02:45.45+00:00,True,False,"Sticky (Shared) Resources allows you to share resources between multiple threads, and dynamically add dependencies between resources to ensure they are handled as one unit.","Parallel,Resources,Resource,Shared,Concurrent",752,False,1.0.0

This fork integrates ericsink's SQLitePCL.bundle_green library to be compatible with Android N. (ONLY works with Android and iOS)

            SQLite.Net PCL is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in SQLite databases.
