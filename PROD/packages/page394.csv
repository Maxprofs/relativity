      QuickCross provides data binding for Android and for iOS. It accelerates development with scaffolders and code snippets, also for a single platform app. For cross-platform apps QuickCross increases code sharing with an Application-Navigator pattern.

      QuickCross aims to leave you in full control; it does not get in the way if you want to do some things differently, and you can simply extend or modify it.

      NOTE: This version (2.0) of QuickCross is in beta now; the iOS data bindings are working but they are currently documented at a minimum level; more elaborate iOS example documentation will be added soon.
      The purpose of this beta release is to gain feedback on the iOS data bindings implementation; if you are building a production application or if you are targeting other platforms than iOS, it is recommended to keep using the previous version until the QuickCross release version is published.
      Versions before 2.0 were published under the name MvvmQuickCross. They will continue to be supported at the existing MvvmQuickCross GitHub repository, and the existing MvvmQuickCross NuGet packages will remain available.
