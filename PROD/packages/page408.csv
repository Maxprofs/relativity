- fixed centralized configs, moving all configs to Configs static class.
- fixed bug in Funcs.IncludtType, where condition needed to be reversed.
- share reflection cache between inspectors for lifetime of appdomain
- add LazyDump extension method, same as Dump, but less likely to conflict with Dump methods from other assemblies.

- fixed bug where cached version of exception could be included in the context if ex.DumpToString() 
  was called and then later the exception was output not using that extension method.
- exception caching is now disabled by default and can be enabled via the config. 
  the cache will only be saved when dumping to string, but the cache will be reused when dumping to any source.
