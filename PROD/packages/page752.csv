BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations

RedisSessionProvider is intended for new ASP.NET projects or existing sites running on .NET 4.5 that want to store user sessions in Redis as opposed to the built-in options. This library exposes a custom SessionStateStoreProviderBase, a Microsoft-created class within the System.Web.SessionState namespace that exists solely for the purpose of changing how your Session data is persisted. Because the .NET Session Module is not modified aside from this class, you should feel more confident that your website's pre-existing use of the Session keyword within webforms and MVC controllers will not exhibit any strange behavior by adding RedisSessionProvider.
