Iron PDF Development Team http://IronPdf.com,2017-01-12T08:28:50.8Z,67,463,"The PDF Library for the C# and the .Net platform.

IronPDF makes it easy to generate pdf documents from within .Net Applications and ASP.NET websites.  The key feature is “Html-To-Pdf” which renders pixel-perfect PDFs from HTML, CSS, Images and JavaScript. 
IronPDF takes the frustration out of creating PDFs because it does not rely on a proprietary set of API functions.  It uses the open standards of HTML5, CSS , JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG and converts them to PDF files.  In short,  it makes good use of skills that developers already posses. 
IronPDF’s features are:
""Html-To-Pdf"" - creating PDF files from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
""Url-To-Pdf"" - generating PDF files from existing html pages by simply providing their URL ""ASPX-To-Pdf"" - Turning ASP.NET web forms directly into into downloadable pdfs 
Html-To-Pdf and Url-To-Pdf may be used from within any Windows application including: ASP.NET projects, MVC , Web Services, Console Applications and Desktop Applications.

The base requirements are .Net Framework 4.0 or above on the Windows platform. IronPDF is also compatible with Microsoft Azure cloud hosting services.



C# Code Example:
————————————
using IronPdf;
//
HtmlToPdf HtmlToPdf = new IronPdf.HtmlToPdf();
PdfResource PDF = HtmlToPdf.RenderHtmlAsPdf(@""<h1>Hello World</h1>"");
PDF.SaveAs(@""Path\File.Pdf"");

 VB.NET Code Example:
————————————
Imports IronPdf
Dim HtmlToPdf As HtmlToPdf = New IronPdf.HtmlToPdf()
Dim PDF As PdfResource = HtmlToPdf.RenderHtmlAsPdf(""<h1>Hello World</h1>"")
PDF.SaveAs(""Path\File.Pdf"")

Iron PDF Development Team http://IronPdf.com,2017-01-12T08:22:55.33Z,67,463,"The PDF Library for the C# and the .Net platform.

IronPDF makes it easy to generate pdf documents from within .Net Applications and ASP.NET websites.  The key feature is “Html-To-Pdf” which renders pixel-perfect PDFs from HTML, CSS, Images and JavaScript. 
IronPDF takes the frustration out of creating PDFs because it does not rely on a proprietary set of API functions.  It uses the open standards of HTML5, CSS , JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG and converts them to PDF files.  In short,  it makes good use of skills that developers already posses. 
IronPDF’s features are:
""Html-To-Pdf"" - creating PDF files from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
""Url-To-Pdf"" - generating PDF files from existing html pages by simply providing their URL ""ASPX-To-Pdf"" - Turning ASP.NET web forms directly into into downloadable pdfs 
Html-To-Pdf and Url-To-Pdf may be used from within any Windows application including: ASP.NET projects, MVC , Web Services, Console Applications and Desktop Applications.

The base requirements are .Net Framework 4.0 or above on the Windows platform. IronPDF is also compatible with Microsoft Azure cloud hosting services.


C# Code Example: ————————————
using IronPdf;
//////
HtmlToPdf HtmlToPdf = new IronPdf.HtmlToPdf();
PdfResource PDF = HtmlToPdf.RenderHtmlAsPdf(@""<h1>Hello World</h1>"");
PDF.SaveAs(@""Path\File.Pdf"");
 VB.NET Code Example:
————————————
Imports IronPdf
Dim HtmlToPdf As HtmlToPdf = New IronPdf.HtmlToPdf()
Dim PDF As PdfResource = HtmlToPdf.RenderHtmlAsPdf(""<h1>Hello World</h1>"")
PDF.SaveAs(""Path\File.Pdf"")
