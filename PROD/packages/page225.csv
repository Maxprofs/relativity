The objects implementations and the structure of the library is presented in need-order instead of a group of data structures categories, this way the name of the collections and methods (what an end user interacts with) provides better suggestion of its functionalities.

The collections implemented do not belong to a deep-inheritance group of base collections, but integrate to the Microsoft .NET Framework collections interfaces plus other new (well integrated) interfaces. This way the dependencies are minimized and the collections performance grows to its best.

In Academy.Collections you will not find any collection contained in the Microsoft .NET Base Class Library (System.Collections namespaces), those are pretty good implementations.
