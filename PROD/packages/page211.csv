Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C.aspx).
