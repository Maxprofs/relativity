Mamadou Samba DIALLO,2016-03-17T19:50:18.677Z,763,764,"This package can deserialize any String, Stream, or StreamReader provide by a web api response. 
Particularity is done on the HAL+JSON response. 
Installation:
On the package console run :
Install-Package HALJSonDeserializer
Usage:
After installation you must include the namespace of the package where you will use it:
using haljson;
So now: suppose that you want to call a web api via ""http://localhost:8080/customer"" in your c# code and to parse it into your custom type called ""Customer"". This can be done simply as follows:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParse<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
For async call you can do this:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParseAsync<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
If you just want to deserialize a Stream, a StreamReader or a string, their are three extrension methods for those type. You can do that as follows:
Customer  theCustomer = myStream.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a Stream
Customer  theCustomer = myStreamReader.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a StreamReader
Customer  theCustomer = myString.ToObject<Customer>(); //For a string",HALJSonDeserializer,False,2016-03-18T10:39:05.44+00:00,True,False,Parckage for deserializing HAL+JSon response datas,,2942,False,1.1.3

Mamadou Samba DIALLO,2016-03-17T19:50:18.677Z,763,764,"This package can deserialize any String, Stream, or StreamReader provide by a web api response. 
Particularity is done on the HAL+JSON response. 
Installation:
On the package console run :
Install-Package HALJSonDeserializer
Usage:
After installation you must include the namespace of the package where you will use it:
using haljson;
So now: suppose that you want to call a web api via ""http://localhost:8080/customer"" in your c# code and to parse it into your custom type called ""Customer"". This can be done simply as follows:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParse<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
For async call you can do this:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParseAsync<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
If you just want to deserialize a Stream, a StreamReader or a string, their are three extrension methods for those type. You can do that as follows:
Customer  theCustomer = myStream.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a Stream
Customer  theCustomer = myStreamReader.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a StreamReader
Customer  theCustomer = myString.ToObject<Customer>(); //For a string",HALJSonDeserializer,False,2016-03-18T10:39:05.44+00:00,True,False,Parckage for deserializing HAL+JSon response datas,,2942,False,1.1.3
