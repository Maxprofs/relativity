 - Two-Way mapping: UFO as a source parameters for the Sql query or Stored procedure accepts entity objects. Of course, also returns the query results as entity objects.

 - No SQL generator: you write Sql queries and/or Stored procedures. Sql code generated by orm's is always slow and twisted.

 - No nested entities and lazy loading: ...or other, slowing down goodies... Sorry. Only clean and fast mapping.

 - POCO Entities: using ""pure"" entity objects without special attributes, additional mapping files or some other rubbish.

 - Extremally fast: UFO only once reads structure of entity objects and parameters of Sql queries / Stored procedures and stores them in local fast cache.

 - MS Sql Server: UFO by default supports Microsoft SQL Server, but its modular design allows you to create a provider for other databases.

 - Batch Insert/Update:  fast insert / update for large amounts of data.

 - Multiple formats for input parameters: 1) Entity parameters (Two-Way mapping) for Sql queries and Stored procedures. 2) Numbered parameters for Sql queries. 3) Ordered parameters for Stored procedures.
 
 - POCOgen: UFO include pure POCO classes generator.
