      =================================
      about this package
      ---------------------------------
      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.
      ---------------------------------

      =================================
      what to expect in future updates?
      ---------------------------------
      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages, so you can click your MVVM-framework together which best fits your needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-commentaries
      - packages with samples
      - validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - many more...

      =================================
      about this package
      ---------------------------------
      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
        - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
        - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues
        
      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available
      ---------------------------------

      =================================
      what to expect in future updates?
      ---------------------------------
      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages, so you can click your MVVM-framework together which best fits your needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-commentaries
      - packages with samples
      - validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - many more...
      
      So stay tuned for updates!

      =================================
      about this package
      ---------------------------------
      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
        - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
        - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues
        
      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available
      ---------------------------------

      =================================
      what to expect in future updates?
      ---------------------------------
      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages, so you can click your MVVM-framework together which best fits your needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-commentaries
      - packages with samples
      - validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - many more...

How to install EmguCV in your project:
1 - Install this NuGet package in project
2 - Project -> Add -> Existing Item
3 - Open this packages directory (Probably is (Solution Directory)/packages/EmguCV.221.xXX.X.X)
4 - Open ""opencv"" directory
5 - Click to display ""All Files (*.*)""
6 - Select all *.dll files
7 - Instead clicking on ""Add"" button, click in the arrow located at this button, and click ""Add as Link""

Q: Why add as link instead simply add files?
A: Because in this mode you don't need to put *.dlls in source control, and you don't need to copy *.dlls twice, since they're already in the NuGet package.

      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
        - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
        - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues
        
      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available

      =================================
      what to expect in future updates?
      ---------------------------------
      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages, so you can click your MVVM-framework together which best fits your needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-commentaries
