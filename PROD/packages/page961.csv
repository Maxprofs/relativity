* Can type on textbox anytime even when the dropdown list is displayed
* Can use mouse scroll on the popup list
* Uses AngularJS 1.3 ng-model-options debounce functionality to prevent fast typist from overwhelming the network
* Keyboard shortcut to popup the list uses the conventional shortcut, Alt+Down, or F4
* Aside from next page / previous page buttons, it has fast forward and fast reverse button, it partition the list by 100 instead of the usual ten for paging. Say we have 5,000 rows, a total of 500 pages, so from first page when we click the fast forward button it brings us to page 51
* Can manually assign both ID/Code and Text for the combobox, by using ng-model and user-input attributes respectively. Think edit
* When pressing escape key, it reverts back the old value. Likewise when pressing tab, yet the user didn't select an item, the combobox will revert to old ID/Code and Text values
* Developer still has control on the requested ajax url's parameter names, and also with the result's list and total's property names. The component doesn't impose any names for the ajax's url parameter names and response property names

It is an ORM toolset that performs: automapper functions, auto CRUD (including joins), auto SQL, auto stored procedure parameter mapping, and more. It creates easy to inspect parametrized SQL that is execution plan and cache friendly.  The SQL that Coocoon ORM generates is the same SQL you yourself might write had you the time.  Cocoon ORM requires no special training.  Examples are plentiful and directly applicable to your code today.  Cocoon includes regression and benchmarking tools for the truly performance paranoid.  Directly compare performance between Cocoon dynamic parametrized SQL and that of traditional stored procedure.  Cocoon ORM leverages data annotation similar to that of the Entity Framework.  Cocoon ORM is for developers who are unwilling to trust the Entity Framework or nHibernate to create and manage their database and database code.  Cocoon ORM can be used in a simplified code first or a code second environment.  Cocoon ORM developers should be comfortable with SQL Server as well.
