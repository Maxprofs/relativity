Its primary use is to produce small fast binary representations of a 'message' or object for serialization or transportation.
There are various implementations of Protocol Buffers in .NET. This project is a fairly close port of the Google Java implementation.

There are two main parts:

tools/protoc.exe, which takes the textual representation of the protocol buffer and turns it into a binary representation for use with ProtoGen.exe.
tools/ProtoGen.exe, which takes binary representations of protocol buffer descriptors (as generated by the ""stock"" protoc binary supplied by Google) and creates C# source code. This is only required at build time.

lib/*/Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll, which is a supporting library. This is required at execution time.

Its primary use is to produce small fast binary representations of a 'message' or object for serialization or transportation.
There are various implementations of Protocol Buffers in .NET. This project is a fairly close port of the Google Java implementation.

There are two main parts:

tools/protoc.exe, which takes the textual representation of the protocol buffer and turns it into a binary representation for use with ProtoGen.exe.
tools/ProtoGen.exe, which takes binary representations of protocol buffer descriptors (as generated by the ""stock"" protoc binary supplied by Google) and creates C# source code. This is only required at build time.

lib/*/Google.ProtocolBuffersLite.dll, which is a supporting library. This is required at execution time.
