        *Pickles* can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients. *Gherkin* language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder. This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word
        - Excel: Microsoft Excel
        - JSON: a custom JSON format

        Optionally, *Pickles* can **integrate test results**, so that your stakeholders know which scenarios pass validation. *Pickles* supports these test formats:

        - NUnit
        - MSTest
        - XUnit

* Its written in .Net 4.0
* Its built to be used every visual studio version no matter if the MS ""automated UI"" is included or not
* Its developed under the MIT license

This beta is the preview of a version which is planned to work at least in VS 2015 community edition (Kind of stand alone).
Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
(See the project templates to download on the project website)
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.

        *Pickles* can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients. *Gherkin* language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder. This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word
        - Excel: Microsoft Excel
        - JSON: a custom JSON format

        Optionally, *Pickles* can **integrate test results**, so that your stakeholders know which scenarios pass validation. *Pickles* supports these test formats:

        - NUnit
        - MSTest
        - XUnit

        *Pickles* can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients. *Gherkin* language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder. This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word
        - Excel: Microsoft Excel
        - JSON: a custom JSON format

        Optionally, *Pickles* can **integrate test results**, so that your stakeholders know which scenarios pass validation. *Pickles* supports these test formats:

		The programmer defines a write directory on the physical filesystem. No file writing done through
		the PhysicsFS API can leave that write directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting
		language cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its I/O, which means that
		untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links can be disabled as well, for added safety.
		For file reading, the programmer lists directories and archives that form a search path. Once
		the search path is defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. This makes
		for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on the disk, and it
		makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override a previous archive on a per-file basis.
