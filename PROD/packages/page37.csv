If you're one of us, you have to use the CustomBinding to query the database, reporting the criteria for sort, group and filter the income data, and then convert back the result to the ViewModels.

Sounds simple, but can become a very complicated and repetitive task.

So I, with the help of some comrades of development, have created a way to automate this in a very generic way.

Before using this, some observations;

This code is highly experimental and has no guarantee that works perfectly in all cases.
It was developed on top of NHibernate, but could works with another ORM tool
