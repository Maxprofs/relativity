OK HOSTING,2017-03-31T19:43:18.047Z,317,385,"This project implements UI generation for Xamarin Forms (Android and iOS) for the OKHOSTING.UI framework

			Open source multi-platform UI framework. Create your apps once on PCL and have your UI generated on runtime for ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, Linux (Mono + WinForms), Mac OS (Mono + WinForms and Xamarin.Mac), iOS, Android, Windows Phone (via Xamarin.Forms) and Windows Universal Platform.

			## Features

			* Create your apps in PCL and run them everywhere, truly multi-platform (web included)
			* The UI is defined from code (XAML designer on the way)
			* 100% native controls are used in all platforms
			* You have only the ""common"" UI api surface among all platforms
			* Supports click, doble click and, for user input controls, value changed events
			* Using OKHOSTING.UI.CSS you can use CSS files to define the styles of your controls on all platforms (thanks to AngleSharp)

			## Supported controls

			* Autocomplete
			* Button
			* Calendar
			* CheckBox
			* HyperLink
			* Image
			* Label
			* ListPicker (equivalent to a DropDownList)
			* PasswordTextBox
			* TextArea
			* TextBox
