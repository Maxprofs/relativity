""AreaProg Framework"" permet d'étendre cela en fournissant des méthodes d'extension permettant de faciliter le développement en .NET et SharePoint.

La partie SharePoint de ce Framework se focalise surtout sur l'amélioration de la gestion des content types. En effet, avec ""AreaProg Framework"", vous définissez vos content types en déclarant une classe C# basique. Celle-ci sera analysé par le ""Framework"" et le content type correspondant sera créé. En plus d'être plus simple que le XML, ce système est églalement plus sûr. Il est également possible d'utiliser par après cette classe pour recupérer, créer, modifier et supprimer des éléments dans des listes de façons très efficace.

Après mesure de performance, l'utilisation de ce Framework s'avère entre 10 et 15 fois plus rapide que LINQ for SharePoint.

En effet, avec ""AreaProg Framework"", vous définissez vos content types en déclarant une classe C# basique. Celle-ci sera analysé par le ""Framework"" et le content type correspondant sera créé. En plus d'être plus simple que le XML, ce système est églalement plus sûr. Il est également possible d'utiliser par après cette classe pour recupérer, créer, modifier et supprimer des éléments dans des listes de façons très efficace.

Après mesure de performance, l'utilisation de ce Framework s'avère entre 10 et 15 fois plus rapide que LINQ for SharePoint.
