Assume you have a detached Company graph with its Contacts attached and want to reflect the state of this graph in the database.

      At present using the Entity Framework you will need to perform the updates of the contacts manually, check if each contact is new and add, check if updated and edit, check if removed then delete it from the database. Once you have to do this for a few different aggregates in a large system you start to realize there must be a better, more generic way.

      Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a free service that enables developers to send messages between servers and client apps. This includes downstream messages from servers to client apps, and upstream messages from client apps to servers.

      For example, a lightweight downstream message could inform a client app that there is new data to be fetched from the server, as in the case of a ""new email"" notification. For use cases such as instant messaging, a GCM message can transfer up to 4kb of payload to the client app. The GCM service handles all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to and from the target client app.",Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Gcm,True,2018-03-14T21:02:35.12+00:00,True,False,Xamarin.Android Bindings for Google Play Services - GCM,,310736,True,28.0.0-beta1
