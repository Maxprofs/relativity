- text search, bidi text search, highlighting, regions and coordinates extraction (including non-latin alphabets)
- images, including masked ones
- annotation objects of various types
- complex paths and fills
- PDF Forms
- all blending modes
- tiling patterns
- shading patterns of type 1,2,3(function-based, axial, radial)
- transparency groups(especially useful when you process files created with Adobe Illustrator)
- masked content(stencil masks, colorkey masks, softmasks)
- all colorspaces specified by PDF(in case of DeviceN we revert to alternative as specified by standard)
- PDF bookmarks + page navigation support
- compatible with Windows 8, WindowsRT and Windows Phone 8, so you may create Windows Store and Windows Phone Store apps that require PDF processing
