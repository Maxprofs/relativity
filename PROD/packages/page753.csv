      =================================
      about this package
      ---------------------------------
      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.
      ---------------------------------

      =================================
      what to expect in future updates?
      ---------------------------------
      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages, so you can click your MVVM-framework together which best fits your needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-commentaries
      - packages with samples
      - validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration

  _about this package_

  This package will enable you to manage and maintain solution agnostic C# code snippets. In other words, snippets in a solution will be deployed automatically upon build - so you can manage snippets on a ""per solution"" basis.
  Just drop the *.snippet files that should be availabe to developers of your solution anywhere under the solution folder (excluding files under your solutions ""packages"" folder).
  SolutionSnippets will discover all those files and deploy them into a special folder ""__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets"" to the current user´s snippet folder.
  (this would be ""{Documents}\Visual Studio 2012\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets\__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets"", where {Documents} is the local user´s documents library.
  This way, SolutionSnippets won´t interfere with already existing snippets.

  It is totally sufficient when there is exactly one project within your solution that installs SolutionSnippets, as all snippets-files under your solution folder will be deployed.

  All you need to do to deploy your solution agnostic snippets is to start a build.
  When building your solution, all existing solution agnostic snippets are removed.
  After that, all snippets in the scope of the current solution are deployed to your user´s snippet folder
  (remember: SolutionSnippets does not touch any existing snippets)

  _under the hood_

  There is (sadly) no black magic involved in deploying solution agnostic snippets. The main work is done by common msbuild-tasks. Only resolving the local user´s snippet folder is done by a custom build-task.

  _known caveats_

  Under certain circumstances Visual Studio does not reflect changes to snippets immediatly. In those cases, just restart the Visual Studio instance.
  In the meantime, go vote for this feature: http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4152530-add-the-ability-to-refresh-individual-or-all-snipp

              - Small but complete. Supports both SAX and DOM style API. SAX parser only a few hundred lines of code.
              - Fast. In the order of magnitude of strlen(). Optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.
              - Self-contained. Minimal dependency on standard libraries. No BOOST, not even STL.
              - Compact. Each JSON value is 16 or 20 bytes for 32 or 64-bit machines respectively (excluding text string storage). With the custom memory allocator, parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.
              - Full  RFC4627 compliance. Supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
              - Support both in-situ parsing (directly decode strings into the source JSON text) and non-destructive parsing (decode strings into new buffers).
              - Parse number to int/unsigned/int64_t/uint64_t/double depending on input
              - Support custom memory allocation. Also, the default memory pool allocator can also be supplied with a user buffer (such as a buffer allocated on user's heap or - programme stack) to minimize allocation.
