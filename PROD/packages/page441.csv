It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

Rob Reynolds,2014-03-02T06:49:19.977Z,1510,1510,"checksum - Command line file checksum validator.
    
checksum checks a file and returns a checksum for both md5 and sha1.
To use checksum you would simply provide a file path and it will return the sum for the file.

    Example: checksum -f=""relative\path""
    Example: checksum ""relative\path""
    Example: checksum -f=""c:\absolute\path"" -t=sha1

You can also check against an existing signature.
To validate against an existing signature (hash) you would simply provide the file and the expected signature. When checking a signature, if the signature is valid it exits with 0, otherwise it exits with a non-zero exit code.

    Example: checksum ""c:\\path\to\somefile.exe"" -c=""thehash""
    Example: checksum -f=""c:\\path\to\somefile.exe"" -c=""thehash"" -t=sha1

SYNOPSIS

Tony,2014-03-01T14:04:08.067Z,1511,1511,"SimpleLPR is a software component aimed at vehicle license plate recognition (see LPR, ANPR). It has a very simple application programming interface that allows applications to supply a path to an image or a pointer to a buffer in memory and to get in return the detected license plate number and its position in the image.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.

It has a very simple application programming interface that allows applications to supply a path to an image or a pointer to a buffer in memory and to get in return the detected license plate number and its position in the image.

It can be used from C++ or any .NET enabled programming language such as Visual Basic .NET, C#, VB Script or JScript. Integration is simple and straightforward as demonstrated in the examples supplied with the SDK.

Typical successful detection rates range from 85% to 95% provided that license plates are in good condition, unoccluded and the text height is larger than 20 pixels.
