      > CheckGenerateToken - create a token automatically via an ITokenProvider
      > Query<T> - query a layer by attribute and / or spatial filters
      > QueryForCount - only return the number of results for the query operation
      > QueryForIds - only return the ObjectIds for the results of the query operation
      > Find - search across n layers and fields in a service
      > ApplyEdits<T> - post adds, updates and deletes to a feature service layer
      > Geocode - single line of input to perform a geocode using a custom locator or the Esri world locator
      > Suggest - lightweight geocode operation that only returns text results, commonly used for predictive searching
      > ReverseGeocode - find location candidates for an input point location
      > Simplify<T> - alter geometries to be topologically consistent
      > Project<T> - convert geometries to a different spatial reference
      > Buffer<T> - buffers geometries by the distance requested
      > DescribeSite - returns a url for every service discovered, for ArcGISOnline or Portal this returns the hosted feature services for a user
      > Ping - verify that the server can be accessed

      REST admin operations:

* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

* The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
* The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
* For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
    - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
    - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
* Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
