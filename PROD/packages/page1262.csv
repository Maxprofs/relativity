This beta is the preview of a version which is planned to work at least in VS 2015 community edition (Kind of stand alone).
Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
(See the project templates to download on the project website)
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.

Pipes can block a thread sending a message while waiting for another thread to be ready to receive that message and vice versa, achieving synchronisation. Pipes can also be asynchronous at either end.

The locking and releasing of pipes is handled transparently and efficiently. The result is much easier to maintain code.

This project was inspired by Communicating Scala Objects although its eventual implementation changed considerably after realising the inherent complexity of what CSO aspires to.

Pipes is designed to be extensible:
* You can create your own pipes, either from the interfaces / base classes, or by combining existing pipes.
* You can extend the fluent building syntax.
* You can create your own inlets / outlets to achieve stricter behaviour. (For example, an inlet which only allows one thread to read from it at once).

-	All method names are converted to use .net style naming convention that is PascalCase rather than camelCase.
-	All Java hashCode methods are converted to GetHashCode.

-	There are certain cases when the method name cannot be converted as it is coming from a java SDK class (i.e. close method present in classes implementing Closable). In such cases we have added a helper method to the class with the proper name (PascalCase).

michaelbradley91,2015-12-26T21:26:01.18Z,839,846,"Pipes is a concurrency abstraction. Threads send messages to each other down pipes.

Pipes can block a thread sending a message while waiting for another thread to be ready to receive that message and vice versa, achieving synchronisation. Pipes can also be asynchronous at either end.

Pipes can be connected together to form pipe systems, which can provide complex behaviour. The resulting system forms a tree of inlets and outlets.

The locking and releasing of pipes is handled transparently and efficiently. The result is much easier to maintain code.

This project was inspired by Communicating Scala Objects although its eventual implementation changed considerably after realising the inherent complexity of what CSO aspires to.

Pipes is designed to be extensible:
* You can create your own pipes, either from the interfaces / base classes, or by combining existing pipes.
* You can extend the fluent building syntax.
* You can create your own inlets / outlets to achieve stricter behaviour. (For example, an inlet which only allows one thread to read from it at once).

Pipes also focusses on letting you decide the rules. While it will enforce safety settings by default, you can choose to ignore them.",Parallel.Pipes,False,2016-01-02T15:09:16.947-08:00,True,False,"Pipes provides a more intuitive tool for managing concurrency.

* Its written in .Net 4.0
* Its built to be used every visual studio version no matter if the MS ""automated UI"" is included or not
* Its developed under the MIT license

This beta is the preview of a version which is planned to work at least in VS 2015 community edition (Kind of stand alone).
Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
(See the project templates to download on the project website)
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.

* Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition should run UI tests.
