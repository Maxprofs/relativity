GroupDocs,2014-07-10T05:55:01.36Z,1117,1380,"GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET is a flexible library that allows you to generate documents by filling out merge fields in PDF or Word templates with data obtained from a DB or user input. The library can be of great help if you need to generate lots of custom documents that have a standard template, but need to be filled out with unique data. These could be invoices, bills, order quotes, offer letters, NDAs, legal documents, insurance policies, etc.

The library comes with a web UI which allows end users to prepare templates and get the completed documents without any assistance from developers. Easy to follow wizards guide end users through the document assembly process, which includes the following steps:

1. Upload a template in a PDF, DOC or DOCX format with merge fields that should be populated with data.

2. Compose an online questionnaire associated with the merge fields in the template and publish it on the web.

3. Invite users to complete the questionnaire.

For each completed questionnaire a new unique document is generated. The document looks exactly like the template but includes data populated into the merge fields.

Key Features & Benefits:

Templates can be filled in with data obtained from web forms or a DB.
Support for different types of form fields: text box, check box, lists and combo, radio buttons, etc.
Ability to set default values and rules for questions (for example set value range and limits for respond length).
Ability to handle JavaScript events (for example onTemplateCreated, onTemplateMerge, etc.).
Documents are generated on-the-fly, each time a questionnaire is completed.
Convenient UI allows end users to generate documents without any assistance from developers.

Lenny Granovsky,2014-07-10T01:59:36.567Z,1380,1380,"The ""Web API Correlator"" enables correlation functionality for Web API and interconnected Web API services within a service composition.

With the increasing complexity of modern distributed SOA systems containing interconnected services, it becomes crucial to determine causal relationships between the services and its clients. It is important to understand the various components that were part of a request flow to support critical scenarios such as health monitoring, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. For this reason many frameworks provide correlation capability. For example, WCF has built-in correlation functionality. 

Although Web API creates (Request.GetCorrelationId()) and carries the Correlation Id throughout the HTTP request handling process, taking care of thread context switches as part of asynchronous nature of processing Web API requests, the boundary for this Correlation Id is limited to a single server-side request-response cycle. In other words, the Correlation Id Web API provides ""out of the box"" is limited to a single service boundary. In essence, Web API lacks ability to correlate processes between client and server, as well as interconnected services chains applicable to many distributed SOA applications. Effectively, we lose ability to relate multiple events immediately as a process crosses the service boundary; the information about multiple linked events within the system become dispersed data records rather representing the related nature of those events. 

The ""Web API Correlator"" enables absent functionality by transferring the Correlation Id from API Client (browser or .NET HttpClient, or .NET WebClient) to the server, propagating it into the server-side Web API process, and forwarding to interconnected Web API services within a service composition.

The ""Web API Correlator"" contains correlation component for .NET, and offers a plugin for jQuery AJAX. The jQuery plug-in manages and maintains the Correlation Id on the client-side and ensures the Correlation Id being added to all AJAX requests.

Traditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that ""aren't there"", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. 

- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.
- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his ""billion-dollar mistake.""
- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.

All this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?
