TARGIT Core Development,2016-08-16T07:41:56.38Z,539,612,"A chart is a visual representation of data. It could be a bar chart, cross tab or a gauge. It could also just be a plain white number on a colored background.

      Traditionally, TARGIT Decision Suite has provided several standard charts, such as the ones mentioned above. After selecting measures and dimensions for a data object, switching between such standard charts has always been quick and easy.

      Should you wish to view your data as, say, a pie chart that looks like an actual real-world pie or as a bunch of green pulsating dots on an animated radar screen, you would not have been unable to do. Until now.

      Creating and using custom chart is made available for C# developers through our TARGIT Chart API NuGet package, free of charge.

      Through our chart API, a C#/Wpf developer can create custom data object types that literally look like anything you could think of, and effortlessly make them available to end users of TARGIT Decision Suite.",TargitChartApi,False,2016-10-28T06:15:52.653-07:00,True,False,An API for building custom charts for use in Targit Decision Suite,TARGIT,20565,False,0.231.0

Ivan Kopcanski,2016-08-16T05:43:00.163Z,19,612,"ExpressWalker provides a generic way to examine and change any object graph in fashion similar to ""Visitor Pattern"". You can build generic hierarchy composition (visitor) capable to ""visit"" and change any object's property, basing on configuration. Uses reflection only while building a visitor and relies purely on expression trees while visiting objects. That's why IT IS WAY FASTER than custom solutions usually built with reflection.

It is optionally protected from circular references so you can avoid StackOverflowException easily. Provides fluent API while building a visitor which increases code readability in terms of recognizing the hierarchy being built right away from the code. Some of functionalities: are visiting properties by matching owner type and name (or only type), visiting through items in collecitons, specifying depth, custom expression for changing property value, cloning etc.
	
//example 1 - IVisitor that visits properties by property names and/or types (start from TypeWalker class):

  var typeVisitor = TypeWalker<Parent>.Create()
                  .ForProperty<Parent, string>(p => p.TestString1, (old, met) => old + met)
                  .ForProperty<Child, DateTime>(p => p.TestDate1, (old, met) => old.AddYears(10))
                  .ForProperty<CommonType>((old, met) => new CommonType { CommonString = ""..."" })
                  .Build();

  var parentClone = new Parent();
  var propertyValues = new HashSet<PropertyValue>()
  typeVisitor.Visit(parentObject, parentClone, 10, new InstanceGuard(), propertyValues); 
  
//example 2 - IVisitor that visits properties by explicit configuration (start from ManualWalker class):

  var manualVisitor = ManualWalker.Create<A1>()
                                    .Property<A1, DateTime>(a1 => a1.A1Date, (va1, met) => va1.AddYears(10))
                                    .Element<A1, B1>(a1 => a1.B1, b1 =>
                                            b1.Property<B1, string>(x => x.B1Name, (vb1, met) => vb1 + ""Test2""))
                                    .Collection<A1, B2>(a1 => a1.B2List, b2 => b2
                                            .Property<B2, DateTime>(x => x.B2Date, (vb2, met) => vb2.AddYears(10)))
                                .Build();

  var parentClone = new A1();
  var propertyValues = new HashSet<PropertyValue>()
  manualVisitor.Visit(parentObject, parentClone, 10, new InstanceGuard(), propertyValues);
			
//Paremeter 'met' in expressions above is optional metadata object set in design-time. 
//It can be set by [VisitorMetadata] property attribute in visited class.
//e.g. in example above, there is [VisitorMetadata(""AnyString"")] on property Parent.TestString1.

Asprise Scanning and Imaging SDK offers a high performance API library for TWAIN WIA scanners so that you can acquire images from and have total control on almost all kinds of scanners and webcams on Windows 32bit and x64. Equip your C# VB.NET Windows Forms and WPF applications with the functionality of high speed document scanning (e.g., bulk scan ADF to multi-page PDF) and image acquisition. Key features include:

* Supports almost all scanners: Acer, AGFA, Brother, Canon, Dell, Epson, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, Kodak, Konica Minolta, Lexmark, NEC, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Ricoh, Samsung, Xerox and many more;

* Scans documents to memory or to files and uploads to web servers or any combination;

* Multiple output formats supported: BMP, JPEG, PNG, multi-page TIFF (LZW, ZIP, CCITT compressions), and PDF;

* Generates thumbnail images in any format supported at the same time the images are acquired;

* Supports PDF/A for compliance requirement and PDF with CCITT G4 compression for ultra small file size;

* Fully customizable high speed ADF (automatic document feeder) duplex bulk scan as well as flatbed scanning;

* Supports advanced features of scanners: imprinter, endorser, barcode and patchcode;

* Efficient barcode reading and recognition (CODE 128, EAN 8/13, UPC, Code 3 of 9, QR, etc.) - even if the scanner doesn't support it;

* Sophisticated configurable blank page detection;

* Modern API and documentation enable you to jump start quickly.
