The RegexStyle allows you to use complex regular expression matching to determine how your features are drawn. A regular expression is a matching syntax that allows you to match a string based on very complex criteria. For example, let's say you have a layer that has a column in the data that contains school names. Most school names include the type of school they are. For instance, you may have ""Lincoln Middle School"" or ""Bush High School."" There are variations to these names though, containing words such as ""Elementary"" or ""Prep."" With a regular expression, you can create matching criteria that will allow you to match on many variations of the names. It is especially useful for fuzzy matches where your data is not clearly categorized. Another classic example is for matching or validating email addresses, where matching rules can become complex. In the RegexStyle, you specify the matching criteria string and also the style you want to use to draw the feature if the criteria matches. It is a simple yet powerful style for dealing with complex rule sets and imprecise data.

Based on the string values of ""High"", Medium"" and ""Low"", we can match on these. If a feature's data for the column matched the string ""High"", then we would use the high ValueItem's styles to draw that feature.

PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database, with additional ""object"" features – with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to store data securely, and to allow for retrieval at the request of other software applications. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications (or for data warehousing) with many concurrent users; on macOS Server, PostgreSQL is the default database; and it is also available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (supplied in most distributions).

The world file contains the geospatial information pertaining to the image. Using the world file, we know its spatial position and other required information to draw it on the map relative to other images or spatial features. World files are small text files with an extension that matches the original image's extension, but with the middle character of the extension changed to a ""w"". If you have images that you want to use but do not have their world files, please contact the source of the image so that they can provide one for you. world files are fairly common in the GIS community.
