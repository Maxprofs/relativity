- Composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.

"Sebastian Urban,PLplot developer community",2018-02-13T20:37:31.993Z,66,66,"PLplot is a cross-platform software package for creating scientific plots 
whose (UTF-8) plot symbols and text are limited in practice only by what 
Unicode-aware system fonts are installed on a user's computer.

The PLplot core library can be used to create standard x-y plots, 
semi-log plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, 
bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) 
may be placed on a single page, and multiple pages are allowed for those 
device formats that support them.

Plot gallery: http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples.php

Documentation: http://plplot.sourceforge.net/docbook-manual/plplot-html-5.13.0/

Output file formats: PDF, PNG, SVG, Xfig and others

Interactive platforms: Windows, X11

==============================

This package provides a complete, but unofficial, .Net binding for PLplot.   

The native PLplot library (x64) for Windows are included in this package.
For Linux, PLplot must be installed on your system and libplplotd.so must
be in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. On Debian and derivatives this can be achieved by 
installing the package libplplot12.

Usage information: 
Create a PLPlot.PLStream object and call its instance methods.
