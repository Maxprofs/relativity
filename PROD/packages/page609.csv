      we performed within the OASIS DSS-X group and offers maximum protection against various types of attacks. From a security point of view, this new protocol
      is just it. The old protocol, as implemented in the original eID DSS, could easily be integrated in an insecure way by the developer. For the new protocol,
      this is no longer possible given the design of the protocol. As we all know that protocols (and their implementation, especially authentication protocols)
      are very vulnerable to attacks, this new protocol is a huge step forward. This makes the new Digital Signature Service truly unique compared to other
