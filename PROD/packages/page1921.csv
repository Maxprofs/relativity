BluAge Corporation,2016-10-13T08:05:11.67Z,154,554,"Summer Batch is a lightweight, reliable, efficient, open-source batch framework for .Net and C# community.  
Its design is driven by the concepts exposed in the JSR-352 specification and provides for .NET 4.5 C# an equivalent to JBatch / Spring Batch.

Key Features:
• Repeatable and customizable batch jobs
• Multi step jobs, with simple step sequences or conditional logic between them
• In-memory or persisted job repository
• Support for a Read-Process-Write logic, as well as arbitrary batchlet for a more complete control on the behavior
• Chunk processing with checkpoint management and restartability
• Step partitioning used for parallel processing
• Database readers and writers, with support for Microsoft® SQL Server, IMB® DB2 and Oracle® databases
• Flat file readers and writers
• Easy mapping between the readers and writers and your domain classes
• Batch contexts at step level and job level
• XML design for the main batch architecture, C# design for the properties
