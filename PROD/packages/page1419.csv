OK HOSTING SC,2016-03-03T23:19:20.263Z,416,778,"This project implements UI generation for the Universal Windows Platform under the OKHOSTING.UI framework

	  Motherfucking cool multi-platform UI framework. Create your apps once on PCL and have your UI generated on runtime for ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, Linux (Mono + WinForms), Mac OS (Mono + WinForms and Xamarin.Mac), iOS, Android, Windows Phone (via Xamarin.Forms) and Windows Universal Platform.

	  ## Features

	  * Create your apps in PCL and run them everywhere, truly multi-platform (web included)
	  * The UI is defined from code (XAML designer on the way)
	  * 100% native controls are used in all platforms
	  * You have only the ""common"" UI api surface among all platforms
	  * Supports click, doble click and, for user input controls, value changed events
	  * Using OKHOSTING.UI.CSS you can use CSS files to define the styles of your controls on all platforms (thanks to AngleSharp)

	  ## Supported controls

	  * Autocomplete
	  * Button
	  * Calendar
	  * CheckBox
	  * HyperLink
	  * Image
