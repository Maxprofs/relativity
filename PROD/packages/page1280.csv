Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-01-07T18:41:18.013Z,764,834,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-01-07T18:41:34.85Z,764,834,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).
