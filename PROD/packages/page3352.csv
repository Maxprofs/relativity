Iron PDF Development Team http://IronPdf.com,2018-02-12T05:19:42.41Z,67,67,"IronPDF allows developers to create, edit and extract pdf content within .Net Applications & websites.

The Iron PDF library takes the frustration out of generating PDF documents by not relying on proprietary APIs. ""Html-To-Pdf"" renders pixel-perfect PDFs from open standard document types: HTML, JS, CSS, JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG. In short, it uses skills that developers already posses.  

Key features include:
* ""Html-To-Pdf"" creates PDF files from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Images.
* ""Url-To-Pdf"" generates PDFs from existing html pages by simply providing their URL.
* ""ASPX-To-Pdf"" converts ASP.NET web forms directly into downloadable pdfs.
* Extract text and images from existing PDFs.
* Merge, Split and Manipulate PDFs to edit PDF structure and content.  Add Page Numbers, Headers, Footers, Watermarks, Tables, Text and Image Assets.
* Edit, Stamp and Watermark PDF files with text, images and HTML
* Apply HTML or PDF backgrounds to PDF pages

IronPDF can be used within ASP.NET projects, MVC, Web Services, Console & Desktop Applications.

Requires .Net Framework 4.0 or above on the Windows platform. Compatible with cloud hosting services including Microsoft Azure.

Licensing & Support available for commercial deployments.

3) A ""query interceptor"" that B) allows direct use of DateTime/Offset within the clauses.
