* The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
* Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
* Handles circular references.
* The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
    - the order in which the properties are dumped;
    - formatting of the property names and/or values;
    - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
    - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;

* The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.

    	This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

		The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

		For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

		This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.
		
		In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or all) of the following packages:
		
		- Eto.Platform.Wpf
		- Eto.Platform.Windows
		- Eto.Platform.Gtk
		- Eto.Platform.Mac
		- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.
