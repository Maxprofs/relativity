ConEmu.Core package contains only essential files - no extras, no Far Manager plugins, no documentation. Full distro and docs are available on the project site.

ConEmu may work as either standalone window, or embeddable console control. And it may host two types of applications:
* ‘console’: cmd, powershell, Far Manager, bash, and many others;
* ‘graphical’ (GUI): Notepad, PuTTY, GVim, mintty and so on.

Short list of features:
* predefined and user-defined tasks for different shells;
* user friendly text and block selection and paste;
* smooth and friendly window resizing;
* Windows 7 Jump Lists and Progress on Taskbar buttons;
* DosBox integration: run old DOS applications (games) in modern OS;
* quake-style and full screen window modes;
* ANSI sequences and Xterm 256 colors;
* cursor: standard console (horizontal) or GUI (vertical);
* customizable starting tabs;
* Far Manager integration: drag-n-drop, tabs, truecolor, thumbnails;

      Supports the following as typed operations:

      > CheckGenerateToken - create a token automatically via an ITokenProvider
      > Query<T> - query a layer by attribute and / or spatial filters
      > QueryForCount - only return the number of results for the query operation
      > QueryForIds - only return the ObjectIds for the results of the query operation
      > Find - search across n layers and fields in a service
      > ApplyEdits<T> - post adds, updates and deletes to a feature service layer
      > Geocode - single line of input to perform a geocode using a custom locator or the Esri world locator
      > Suggest - lightweight geocode operation that only returns text results, commonly used for predictive searching
      > ReverseGeocode - find location candidates for an input point location
      > Simplify<T> - alter geometries to be topologically consistent
      > Project<T> - convert geometries to a different spatial reference
      > Buffer<T> - buffers geometries by the distance requested
      > DescribeSite - returns a url for every service discovered, for ArcGISOnline or Portal this returns the hosted feature services for a user
      > Ping - verify that the server can be accessed
      > Info - return the server information such as version and token authentication settings
      > DescribeServices - return service information (name, sublayers etc.)
      > DescribeLayer - return layer information

      REST admin operations:

      > PublicKey - admin operation to get public key used for encryption of token requests
      > ServiceStatus - admin operation to get the configured and actual status of a service
      > ServiceReport - admin operation to get the service report
      > StartService - admin operation to start a service
      > StopService - admin operation to stop a service
