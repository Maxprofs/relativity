      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
	  - Xamarin.iOS
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:	  
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
	  - Parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Supports fluent syntax
      - Excellent performance",MugenMvvmToolkit.Touch,True,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",-1,False,1.0.3-beta1

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
	  - Xamarin.iOS
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:	  
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
	  - Parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Supports fluent syntax

- No fixed scheme for table names (construction and access on the fly).
- Tables can reside in mixed locations: different folders, hard drives, memory.
- Database indexes (keys) never need to be defragmented. Speed of insert/update/remove operations doesn't grow up during the time.
- Ability to access Key/Value pair of a table by physical link, what can economize time for joining necessary data structures.
- No limits for database size (except ""long"" size for each table and physical resources constraints).
- Low memory and physical space consumption, also while random inserts and updates. Updates reside the same physical space, if possible.
- High performance of CRUD operations. When you need, unleash DBreeze power and get 500000 key/value pairs insert or 260K updates per second per core into sorted table on the hard drive of standard PC.
- High speed of random keys batch insert and updates (batch must be sorted in memory ascending and non-overwrite flag must be set).
- Range selects / Traversing (Forward, Backward, From/To, Skip, StartsWith etc). Remove keys, change keys.
- Keys and values, on the low level, are always byte arrays. 
- Max. key size is 65KB, max. value size is 2GB. Value can be represented as a set of columns, where can be stored data types of fixed or dynamic length. Every dynamic datablock can be of size 2GB.

- Nested / Fractal tables which can reside inside of master tables values.

      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings

      _about this package_

      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo
