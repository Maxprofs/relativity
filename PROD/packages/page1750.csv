Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-16T15:19:25.563Z,549,643,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

The coming sample XAML project will give an example of how to implement via bindings.

Usage:
    xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

    <roxv:VideoView AutoPlay=""True"" LoopPlay=""True"" ShowController=""True"" VideoSource=""http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4"" />

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Common Questions:
 Q: Why is the pcl named "".Portable""?
 A: There is a .NETStandardv1.4 version ready to go, I am just waiting to see what happens with ""project.json"".

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?
 A: You can have all the profits made from this component. So, no Tim, you don't.

 Q: Would you like another coffee?
 A: Don't ask, give.

What people are saying about the VideoView control:
 - ""It is awesome"" -me
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about"" -random guy on the street
 - ""I wanna punch that rabbit in the head"" - my brother
 - ""That's nice, dear"" -my mum
 - ""It's better than Lego"" -me
 - ""But I can already watch p0rn on my phone"" -name withheld (see I didn't tell them your name, Gav)
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about, and NO! I do not want to go back to your place and make our own video, creep."" -random girl on the street
 - ""I am pretty sure this will revolutionise the IT industry"" -me
 - ""If you don't shut up I will punch YOU in the head"" - my brother
 - ""What do you mean by a zammering video? Sounds like something I can't click on at work."" - Sid
 - ""Do you have to keep playing that same stupid rabbit video over and over?"" - Tim

Matthew S. Dippel,2016-07-16T16:21:32.27Z,643,643,"Enums and Delegates are a fundimental component of .Net, however, as of version 6.0 of the C# language, there's no way to (directly) constrain a generic parameter to System.Enum or System.Delegate. There's so many reasons to want to do so, not the least of which is the set of kludgy static methods on Enum and Delegate that would really benefit from generic implementations.

This package addresses that need.  Written in C++/CLI since C# cannot declare an enum or delegate restriction, this library provides a set of well performing extension and static methods off of the ""Diagonactic.Enums"" class that provide a more readable way of performing common operations on enums and delegates, all of which can be consumed by C# code.

Enum methods are stable, Delegate methods are considered ""Beta"".  As a result, the API for Delegate methods may be modified (Obsolete tags for invalid members will be added if this happens), though every effort will be made to avoid this.  Enum methods are API stable, however, methods are added occasionally.

All stable methods are unit tested for all underlying types with complete code coverage.
