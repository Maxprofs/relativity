This library is capable of generating and verifying both TOTP and HOTP authentication codes.  The calculations in this library are known to be compatible with Google 2-Step Verification and consequently the Google Authenticator smartphone app.  It is also known to be able to generate codes for Amazon Web Services Multi Factor Authentication and Dropbox 2 step authentication.

Persistence of the keys, secure key storage, ensuring that a single code can't be validated multiple times and other things are not a part of this library.
