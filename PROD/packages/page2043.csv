ConEmu.Core package contains only essential files - no extras, no Far Manager plugins, no documentation. Full distro and docs are available on the project site.

ConEmu may work as either standalone window, or embeddable console control. And it may host two types of applications:
* ‘console’: cmd, powershell, Far Manager, bash, and many others;
* ‘graphical’ (GUI): Notepad, PuTTY, GVim, mintty and so on.

Short list of features:
* predefined and user-defined tasks for different shells;
* user friendly text and block selection and paste;
* smooth and friendly window resizing;
* Windows 7 Jump Lists and Progress on Taskbar buttons;
* DosBox integration: run old DOS applications (games) in modern OS;
* quake-style and full screen window modes;
* ANSI sequences and Xterm 256 colors;

-Ability to perform single and batch processing of CRUD operations on all QuickBooks entities.

-Request and Response Handler has common interface with two implemented classes to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

-Support for both XML and JSON Request and Response format.

-Ability to configure app settings in the configuration file requiring no additional code change.

-Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of QuickBooks API calls.

-Retry policy constructors to help apps handle transient errors.
