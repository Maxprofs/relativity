Irmen de Jong,2016-10-10T22:52:17.02Z,85,557,"Serpent Python literal expression serialization.

Serpent provides Python ast.literal_eval() compatible object tree serialization.
It serializes an object tree into bytes that can be transferred to Python and
decoded there (using ast.literal_eval()). It can ofcourse also deserialize
such a Python expression itself, back into the equivalent .NET datatypes.
