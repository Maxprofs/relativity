Named registering : You can also name them if you want to store several instances of a type or retrieve them easily by name.

Caching Strategy : by default you get new instances every time you try to get one. You can also keep alive instances and cache them.

EasyLocator uses Reflection to Resolve not registered types . Also registering ViewModels for example is not required. EasyLocator registers them and instanciates them for you .
