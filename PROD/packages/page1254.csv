* Its developed under the MIT license

This beta is the preview of a version which is planned to work at least in VS 2015 community edition (Kind of stand alone).
Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.

Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.

* Its built to be used in Visual Studio 2013
* Its developed under the MIT license

This beta is the preview of a version which is planned to work at least in VS 2015 community edition (Kind of stand alone).
Like for all my assemblies, even minor versions are releases, odds are betas like this one.

Actually you should have 2013 installed and set the assembly references like in the versions before. The test project then should run in VS 2015 Community edition.
For the final release I planned to bring some project templates online, and also a kind of ""configuration utility"" which sets all needed references and files according to the current system. VS 2012 installed, Enterprise available, complete stand-alone and so on.
