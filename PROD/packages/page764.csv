      The types in this package are implemented in IL which allows them to be used on non-SIMD enabled JIT compilers and hardware. However, in order to actually use SIMD instructions, you'll need to run on a JIT compiler that knows about these types in order to emit SIMD instructions. The JIT shipped with the current .NET runtime does not. The .NET code generation team has published a CTP of the the new JIT, codenamed ""RyuJIT"". The CTP adds SIMD support when compiling for x64.
