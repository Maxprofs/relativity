If they match, it will then draw the Feature using the properties of the IconValueItem. In this way, you can render different data with different icons or text.

The RegexStyle allows you to use complex regular expression matching to determine how your features are drawn. A regular expression is a matching syntax that allows you to match a string based on very complex criteria. For example, let's say you have a layer that has a column in the data that contains school names. Most school names include the type of school they are. For instance, you may have ""Lincoln Middle School"" or ""Bush High School."" There are variations to these names though, containing words such as ""Elementary"" or ""Prep."" With a regular expression, you can create matching criteria that will allow you to match on many variations of the names. It is especially useful for fuzzy matches where your data is not clearly categorized. Another classic example is for matching or validating email addresses, where matching rules can become complex. In the RegexStyle, you specify the matching criteria string and also the style you want to use to draw the feature if the criteria matches. It is a simple yet powerful style for dealing with complex rule sets and imprecise data.

For example, let's say you have some data that contains states, and each state is categorized as either a high, medium or low pollution state. Based on the string values of ""High"", Medium"" and ""Low"", we can match on these. If a feature's data for the column matched the string ""High"", then we would use the high ValueItem's styles to draw that feature. This can be applied to all kinds of things such as road classification and more.

 A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically from geographic information. This International Standard defines a ""map"" to be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats.

 This type of layer is used to draw standard image types on the map. These include .BMP, .JPG, .PNG, .TIFF, and all other image types that are supported by the .NET Framework to be loaded as a Bitmap. Each of these images will need a world file associated with it. The world file contains the geospatial information pertaining to the image. Using the world file, we know its spatial position and other required information to draw it on the map relative to other images or spatial features. World files are small text files with an extension that matches the original image's extension, but with the middle character of the extension changed to a ""w"". If you have images that you want to use but do not have their world files, please contact the source of the image so that they can provide one for you. world files are fairly common in the GIS community.
