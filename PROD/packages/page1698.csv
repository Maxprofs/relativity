            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
