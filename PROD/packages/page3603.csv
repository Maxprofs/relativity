Utilize Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA) to capture and acquire images from scanners, digital cameras, and video streaming devices. Programmatically control devices or use the default WIA driver dialog to control the captured image's color, resolution, size, and more.


With the LEADTOOLS WIA package, you can:

   • Control any scanner, digital camera, or streaming video device that has a WIA driver 
   • Acquire images from a specified source
   • Use the default user-interface included with the WIA driver
   • Determine the currently selected device type at runtime
   • Enumerate all available WIA devices and enumerate all child items for certain specified parent item
   • Create your own user-interface to provide your users with a consistent look and feel with all deveices
   • Bypass the user-interface entirely for completely automated tasks or batch scanning
   • Control the type of image that is acquired (black & white, halftone, grayscale, or color) as supported by the device)
   • Control the resolution (dpi), position, size, and orientation of the acquired image
   • Use the Automated Document Feeder for single and multi-page scans, including support for duplex scanning
   • Use selection dialogs to allow selection of WIA source, or select among multiple WIA sources via code
   • Specify memory- or file-transfer mode when acquiring from a WIA device
   • Use compression for both memory and file transfer modes. The scanned data can be compressed using JPEG, JBIG, JPEG 2000, PNG, RLE, or CCITT G3/G4
   • Get and set WIA 1.0 and 2.0 properties that the WIA device driver supports

** Medical Viewing and Annotation **

The LEADTOOLS Medical Viewer Control is a high-level component for developers to build medical display solutions such as view stations, teleradiology applications, and high-end diagnostic workstations found in radiology and other medical specialty departments.  Whether you are building a PACS viewer for radiology, cardiology, mammography, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology, dentistry, or any other specialty, the DICOM Viewer Control eliminates complexity from your projects and sets a solid DICOM and imaging foundation on which you can rely.  For an HTML5/JavaScript Zero-footprint version of the Medical Viewer, go to https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/html5

LEADTOOLS DICOM Annotations provides two different means for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS annotations in a DICOM data set.

   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).

   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.


** 3D Reconstruction and Visualization **

LEADTOOLS provides world-class Medical 3D technology that reconstructs three-dimensional visual representations from two-dimensional image slices, such as MRI and CT stacks. LEADTOOLS Medical 3D Technology offers many different data representations using various 3D reconstruction techniques such as MPR, VRT, MIP, MinIP, and SSD, and projection techniques that support clipping planes, slab, scale, zoom, camera control, threshold, transparency, and image processing.


** DICOM Data Set **

LEADTOOLS provides complete support for DICOM data sets described in the latest DICOM specification and supplements, including all IOD classes and modalities such as CR, CT, MR, NM, US, RF, SC, and VL.


** Image Processing **

LEADTOOLS includes libraries that offer an advanced set of functions specially designed to enhance and analyze medical images regardless of the format or data distribution. You can enhance the image or highlight the details by shifting, selecting, subtracting, and removing the background. This flexibility allows doctors and specialists to diagnose diseases and injuries faster and more accurately.

   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).

   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.

Chris F Carroll,2018-03-28T22:58:45.293Z,12,23,"*TestBase* gives you a flying start with fluent assertions that
are easy to extend and tools for testing with dependencies 
on AspNetMvc, HttpClient, Ado.Net, Streams and Logging.

Chainable fluent assertions get you to the point concisely:
```
- ShouldEqualByValue() & ShouldEqualByValueExceptFor() 
  work with all kinds of object and collections, and 
  report what differed.
- string.ShouldMatch().ShouldEqualIgnoringCase(), ...
- numeric.ShouldBeBetween().ShouldEqualWithTolerance(), ...
- IEnumerable.ShouldAll().ShouldContain().ShouldNotContain(), ...
- Stream.ShouldHaveSameStreamContentAs(), Stream.ShouldContain()

  .ShouldBeViewWithModel<TModel>()
  .Payload
    .ShouldEqualByValueExceptFor(new {Id=1, Payload1=expected}, ignoreFields)
    .Payload2
      .ShouldMatchIgnoringCase(""I expected this"");
```

TestBase.HttpClient.Fake
------------------------

```
var uut = new FakeHttpClient()
      .Setup(x=>x.RequestUri.PathAndQuery.StartsWith(""/this""))
        .Returns(response)
      .Setup(x=>x.Method==HttpMethod.Put)
        .Returns(new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.Accepted));
```

TestBase.FakeDb

  .ShouldHaveRouteValue(""expectedKey"", [Optional] ""expectedValue"");

ShouldHaveViewDataContaining(), ShouldBeJsonResult() etc.
```

TestBase.Mvc for netstandard20 & AspNetCore Mvc
---------------------------------------------------------

- Test most controllers with zero setup using 
  `controllerUnderTest.WithControllerContext(actionUnderTest)`
- Test more complex controller/application dependencies using 
  `HostedMvcTestFixtureBase` and specify your MVCApplications `Startup` class.

```
[TestCase(""/dummy"")]
public async Task Put_Should_ReturnA(string url)
{
    var httpClient=GivenClientForRunningServer<Startup>();
    GivenRequestHeaders(httpClient, ""CustomHeader"", ""HeaderValue1"");

    result.ShouldBe_202Accepted();
}
```

TestBase.Mvc Version 3 for Net4
-------------------------------

Fake your http request &amp; context, and use the `RegisterRoutes` method 
of your actual application to setup `Controller.Url`

```
ControllerUnderTest
  .WithHttpContextAndRoutes(
    RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes, 
    ""/incomingurl""
