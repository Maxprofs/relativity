With astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.
We have built the SSO Toolkit on top of IAM Cloud’s powerful identity engine, allowing applications to accept users from an enormous range of different sources and repositories, including Active Directory, WorkDay, PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle and many more.

Our Toolkit allows developers and IT Pros to focus instead on their own area of expertise, knowing the IAM is being handled by our technology.
With astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.
We have built the SSO Toolkit on top of IAM Cloud’s powerful identity engine, allowing applications to accept users from an enormous range of different sources and repositories, including Active Directory, WorkDay, PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle and many more.
Authentication is achieved, we then respond with expected attributes directly from our Cloud Vault.
