Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand.

Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes.

The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand.

Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes.

========================

A simple C# based State Machine that can be configured via State Transitions based on an idea by [Juliet](http://stackoverflow.com/users/40516/juliet) ""[Simple state machine example in C#?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5923767/simple-state-machine-example-in-c)""

# DESCRIPTION

The project contains an extendable StateMachine that defines a few simple states and two conditions (""Continue"", ""Cancel"") that can be used to advance (transition) through that state machine.

When instatiating the StateMachine with the default constructor the following states, conditions and transitions will be set up per default

## States

* Running
* InternalErrorState
* Completed
* Cancelled
* Disposed


## Conditions

* Continue
* Cancel


## Transitions

Source state | Condition | Target state
:-----|:-----|:------
Created | Continue | Running
Created | Cancel | InternalErrorState
Running | Continue | Completed
Running | Cancel | Cancelled
Completed | Continue | Disposed
Completed | Cancel | InternalErrorState
Cancelled | Continue | Disposed
Cancelled | Cancel | InternalErrorState
InternalErrorState | Continue | Disposed


## Basic functionalities

1. The [`Continue`](./biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/StateMachine.cs#L94) condition makes a transition from an arbitrary state to the next state as the ""good case""
1. The [`Cancel`](./biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/StateMachine.cs#L02) condition makes a transition from an arbitrary state to the next state as the ""bad case""
1. Furthermore there is the [`GetNext`](./biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/StateMachine.cs#L306) method to transit to the next state based on a given condition.

There are as well methods for exporting and importing the configuration along with the states:

* [`GetStringRepresentation()`](https://github.com/dfensgmbh/biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/blob/master/biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/StateMachine.cs#L345)
* [`SetupStateMachine(String configuration, String currentState = null, String previousState = null)`](https://github.com/dfensgmbh/biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/blob/master/biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine/StateMachine.cs#L135)",biz.dfch.CS.StateMachine,False,2016-01-04T06:37:56.77-08:00,True,False,"A simple C# based State Machine that can be configured via State Transitions based on an idea by [Juliet](http://stackoverflow.com/users/40516/juliet) ""[Simple state machine example in C#?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5923767/simple-state-machine-example-in-c)""","dfch,fsm,C#",1722,False,1.0.1
