Welcome to lifeIMAGE Agent!  This utility connects your enterprise data sources with lifeIMAGE 
to create powerful workflows using extensible connection framework.  Built-in bi-directional
connectors include PACS, HL7, lifeIMAGE, and file.  Build your own additional connectors or
contact lifeIMAGE for support.

Starting with no prior configuration, the following is the expected setup sequence: 

1) Install dotnet core if you do not have it already from https://www.microsoft.com/net/core
2) Install the lifeIMAGE Agent by typing ""nuget install lifeimage-agent""
3) Execute setup.sh (Mac or Linux) or setup.cmd (Windows) and follow the prompts.
4) Upon successful completion, the Agent will be operational.
5) Run setup anytime to add or modify any connections and settings.
6) You can modify the configuration remotely via lifeIMAGE Mobile for iOS.

Welcome to lifeIMAGE Agent!  This utility connects your enterprise data sources with lifeIMAGE 
to create powerful workflows using extensible connection framework.  Built-in bi-directional
connectors include PACS, HL7, lifeIMAGE, and file.  Build your own additional connectors or
contact lifeIMAGE for support.

Starting with no prior configuration, the following is the expected setup sequence: 

1) Install dotnet core if you do not have it already from https://www.microsoft.com/net/core
2) Install the lifeIMAGE Agent by typing ""nuget install lifeimage-agent""
3) Execute setup.sh (Mac or Linux) or setup.cmd (Windows) and follow the prompts.
4) Upon successful completion, the Agent will be operational.
5) Run setup anytime to add or modify any connections and settings.
