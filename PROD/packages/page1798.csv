Ivan Kopcanski,2016-08-09T20:48:53.203Z,19,619,"ExpressWalker provides a generic way to examine and change any object graph in fashion similar to ""Visitor Pattern"". You can build generic hierarchy composition (visitor) capable to ""visit"" and change any object's property, basing on configuration. Uses reflection only while building a visitor and relies purely on expression trees while visiting objects. That's why IT IS WAY FASTER than custom solutions usually built with reflection.

It is optionally protected from circular references so you can avoid StackOverflowException easily. Provides fluent API while building a visitor which increases code readability in terms of recognizing the hierarchy being built right away from the code. Some of functionalities: are visiting properties by matching owner type and name (or only type), visiting through items in collecitons, specifying depth, custom expression for changing property value, cloning etc.
	
//example 1 - IVisitor that visits properties by property names and/or types (start from TypeWalker class):

  var typeVisitor = TypeWalker<Parent>.Create()
                  .ForProperty<Parent, string>(p => p.TestString1, (old, met) => old + met)
                  .ForProperty<Child, DateTime>(p => p.TestDate1, (old, met) => old.AddYears(10))
                  .ForProperty<CommonType>((old, met) => new CommonType { CommonString = ""..."" })

These features leave no chance to mistypings or problems arising from db entity refactorings.
It is mandatory to use VS2015 or an equivalent build environment.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql.
- Composite primary keys are supported.
- Compatible with component model data annotations.
- Opt-in relationships.
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries.
- A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
- A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes, have their mappings programmatically set, or using your own custom convention.

- Composite primary keys are supported.
- Compatible with component model data annotations.
- Opt-in relationships.
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries.
- A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
- A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.

MoonStorm,2016-08-09T17:28:21.82Z,1,619,"The fastest micro-orm extension for Dapper is built around essential features of the C# 6 / VB 14 that have finally raised the simplicity of raw SQL constructs to acceptable maintenance levels. 
These features leave no chance to mistypings or problems arising from db entity refactorings.
It is mandatory to use VS2015 or an equivalent build environment.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql.
- Composite primary keys are supported.
- Compatible with component model data annotations.
- Opt-in relationships.
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries.
- A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
- A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes, have their mappings programmatically set, or using your own custom convention.
