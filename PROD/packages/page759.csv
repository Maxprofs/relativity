      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

2. No client-side installation required. Users can view and annotate any document from any device that has a web-browser with HTML5 support. So, no need for Acrobat Reader, for example, when annotating PDF documents.

3. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library comes with a comprehensive set of commenting tools, which allow end users to highlight, strikethrough, mark up text within a document, draw freehand lines, add sticky notes and comment on images. Annotated documents can be printed, exported to PDF and downloaded right from your web app.

      _about this package_

      This package includes binaries only. You should use this package for test projects or assemblies that need to interact with types in Blue.MVVM.
      For a head start, use Blue.MVVM (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM/) instead.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      + XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation

Microsoft,2014-08-13T21:46:41.41Z,10,1346,"This package includes the class Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource which enables firing ETW events from managed code. This is the ""runtime"" or ""redist"" EventSource package and should be referenced directly only by other NuGet packages that need the EventSource functionality. Application developers that need this functionality should instead reference the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource NuGet package which provides an enhanced developer experience.

      This package enables defining a strongly typed specification of an ETW provider that can be called by managed code. The EventSource class is also included in the .NET Framework. This package provides a newer version that has more features. It is meant to be used as a stop gap until those features it contains are ported to System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.

      For more details, have a look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx.

      New features:
      - ETW channel support
      - Support for static registration

      Supported Platforms:

Have Any Number of Columns
Don't be forced into having a fixed number of columns across a whole page. You can have whatever you want, wherever you need it.

Scales to Any Width
Because it uses percentages, your fluid columns will fit into any width. The margins (gutters) use percentages too.

It's Smart
There's no need to hack in any offsets or marginless final columns. It's the last time you need to use .last and the end of .end.
