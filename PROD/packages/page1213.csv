"Xeno Innovations,Xamarin",2015-11-30T03:15:38.08Z,43209,872,"Xwt-Alt is just Xwt with an actual version number.

Xwt is a new .NET framework for creating desktop applications that run on multiple platforms from the same codebase. Xwt works by exposing one unified API across all environments that is mapped to a set of native controls on each platform.

This means that Xwt tends to focus on providing controls that will work across all platforms. However, that doesn't mean that the functionality available is a common denominator of all platforms. If a specific feature or widget is not available in the native framework of a platform, it will be emulated or implemented as a set of native widgets.

Xwt can be used as a standalone framework to power the entire application or it can be embedded into an existing host. This allows developers to develop their ""shell"" using native components (for example a Ribbon on Windows, toolbars on Linux) and use Xwt for specific bits of the application, like dialog boxes or cross platform surfaces.

Xwt works by creating an engine at runtime that will map to the underlying platform. These are the engines that are supported on each platform:

Windows: WPF engine, Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
MacOS X: Cocoa engine (using MonoMac) and Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
Linux: Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
This means for example that you can write code for Xwt on Windows that can be hosted on an existing WPF application (like Visual Studio) or an existing Gtk# application (like MonoDevelop). Or on Mac, you can host Xwt on an existing Cocoa/MonoMac application or you can host it in our own MonoDevelop IDE.",Xwt-Alt,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,"Xwt-Alt is just Xwt with an actual version number.

Xwt is a new .NET framework for creating desktop applications that run on multiple platforms from the same codebase. Xwt works by exposing one unified API across all environments that is mapped to a set of native controls on each platform.

This means that Xwt tends to focus on providing controls that will work across all platforms. However, that doesn't mean that the functionality available is a common denominator of all platforms. If a specific feature or widget is not available in the native framework of a platform, it will be emulated or implemented as a set of native widgets.

Xwt can be used as a standalone framework to power the entire application or it can be embedded into an existing host. This allows developers to develop their ""shell"" using native components (for example a Ribbon on Windows, toolbars on Linux) and use Xwt for specific bits of the application, like dialog boxes or cross platform surfaces.

Xwt works by creating an engine at runtime that will map to the underlying platform. These are the engines that are supported on each platform:

Windows: WPF engine, Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
MacOS X: Cocoa engine (using MonoMac) and Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
Linux: Gtk engine (using Gtk#)
This means for example that you can write code for Xwt on Windows that can be hosted on an existing WPF application (like Visual Studio) or an existing Gtk# application (like MonoDevelop). Or on Mac, you can host Xwt on an existing Cocoa/MonoMac application or you can host it in our own MonoDevelop IDE.",Xwt-Alt,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,"Xwt-Alt is just Xwt with an actual version number.
