BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options

PBKDF2.NET allows you to dynamically specify any valid System.Security.HMAC-derived hash algorithm implementation, whether a built-in .NET type or a custom implementation. To use your own custom System.Security.Cryptography.HMAC-derived implementation, you simply register your type with the application domain (for example: via the CryptoConfig class) and you will be able to provide it's identifier string to the constructor when initializing an instance of System.Security.Cryptography.PBKDF2.

A robust configuration implementation is also included via the System.Configuration.PBKDF2Section class. With this configuration section, you can specify a default iteration count, a default HMAC algorithm and a default salt size. When any of these values are not specified during initialization, the configured defaults are used. Upon installation of the package, the following configuration defaults will be assigned:

    algorithm:            HMACSHA1
    iterationCount:     1000         (MIN: 1, MAX: Int.MaxValue)
    saltSize:                8 (bytes)    (MIN: 8, MAX: 65536)
