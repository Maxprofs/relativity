      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Mono for Android
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args))
      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
      - Supports fluent syntax

Decide the number of columns you want in a row & set the margin you want to use. Some sweet maths will do the heavy lifting for you.

Have Any Number of Columns
Don't be forced into having a fixed number of columns across a whole page. You can have whatever you want, wherever you need it.

Scales to Any Width
Because it uses percentages, your fluid columns will fit into any width. The margins (gutters) use percentages too.

It's Smart
There's no need to hack in any offsets or marginless final columns. It's the last time you need to use .last and the end of .end.

Put the Content First
Instead of fitting your content to your grid, you can make your grid suit your content. Doesn't that feel good?

It Fits In with You
It plugs into your existing HTML and CSS, and it's so easy to do so. It's your friend.

Simple Breakpoints
Mobile versions of the grid are already baked in, or you can cook up your own.

t's Easy
Use it on as simple or as complex a project as you wish. You'll be done in minutes.
