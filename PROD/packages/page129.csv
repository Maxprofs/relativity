NDatabase is a new generation Object Database: a real native and transparent persistence layer for .Net.

 - Object because the basic persistent unit is an object, not a table.

 - Native and Transparent because it directly persists objects the way they exist in the native programming language, without any conversion.

No more Relational to Object mapping is necessary, NDatabase just persists objects the way they are, no matter their complexity.",NDatabase,False,2013-05-12T09:41:15.04-07:00,True,False,C# Lightweight Object Database,"C#,Embedded,Object,Database",13335,False,1.0.4
