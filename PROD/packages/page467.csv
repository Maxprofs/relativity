Features:
- Custom user-defined data types
    C# native data types have been implemented
        Boolean/bool
        Byte/byte, Char/char, SByte/sbyte

        String/string (supports C# escape sequences including unicode \xX(XXX) \uXXXX and \UXXXXXXXX)
        Single/float, Double/double
        DateTime is not implemented as it does not have a literal format in C#. But it can be implemented by the user.
- Variables, static and dynamic.
- Custom user-defined operators
    Default C# binary operators have been implemented for all native data types
        Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %

    Explicit type casts: eg. (Boolean), (int), etc.
- Customizable functions
    Default C# Math functions have been implemented
        Generic functions: Abs(), Ceiling(), Exp(), Floor(), Log(), Log10(), Max(), Min(), Pow(), Round(), Sign(), Sqrt(), Truncate()
    Trigometric functions: Acos(), Asin(), Atan(), Atan2(), Cos(), Sin(), Tan()

As a wrapper for the native OCI API (Oracle Call Interface), the name 'Simple Oracle Call Interface' was quite obvious - until the 2.0 release, when the internal architecture was largely redesigned to allow the use of backends that support other database servers. We have kept the same name to indicate that Oracle is the main supported technology in the sense that the library includes only those features that were naturally implemented in Oracle. With the 2.1 release of the library, two new backends were added (MySQL and SQLite3) and we decided to drop the original full name so that new users looking for a library supporting any of these simpler libraries are not discouraged by seeing 'Oracle' somewhere in the name. The other possible interpretation was 'Syntax Oriented Call Interface', which stresses the fact that SOCI was built to support the most natural and easy interface for the user that is similar to the Embedded SQL concept (see below). But on the other hand, SOCI also provides other features (like object-relational mapping) and as a whole it is not just 'emulator' of the Embedded SQL.

Jeffrey Stedfast,2014-04-07T14:20:09.603Z,6,1474,"MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME, S/MIME and PGP messages on desktop and mobile platforms. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox files.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and about 75x faster than SharpMimeTools).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.

		The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

		For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

		This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

		- Eto.Platform.Wpf

Jeffrey Stedfast,2014-04-07T14:21:52.03Z,6,1474,"MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME messages. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox files.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and about 75x faster than SharpMimeTools).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.
