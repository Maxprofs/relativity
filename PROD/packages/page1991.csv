It includes Spire.Doc, Spire XLS, Spire.Presentation, Spire.PDF, Spire.DataExport, Spire.PDFViewer, Spire.DocViewer and Spire.BarCode. Spire.Office contains the most up-to-date versions of the above .NET components.

With Spire.Office for .NET, developers can create a wide range of applications. It enables developers to open, create, modify, convert, print, View MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF documents. Furthermore, it allows users to export data to popular files such as MS Word/Excel/RTF/Access, PowerPoint, PDF, XPS, HTML, XML, Text, CSV, DBF, Clipboard, SYLK, etc.

As an independent Office .NET component, Spire.Office doesn't need Microsoft Office to be installed on neither the development nor target systems. In addition, it is a better alternative to MS Office Automation in terms of security, stability, scalability, speed, price and features.
