Introduction

Grapevine is a .NET class library focused on solving two problems:

1. Easily embedding a REST/HTTP servers in your application
2. Easily consume REST resources in your application

The focus is on simplicity, and Grapevine is intended for use in applications for which being a REST or HTTP client or server is not the primary function or purpose of the application - however many people are using it as a lightweight alternative to IIS or Apache.

ASH was built with the mobile developer in mind, and requires no previous experience with backends as a service (BaaS).

In just four lines of code, you can connect your app to the cloud with online/offline synchronization and automatic conflict resolution. Authenticating users with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft accounts, Azure AD, and Azure B2C is dead simple as well - just one line of code. ASH even takes care of securely storing access tokens and refreshing them regularly, with no extra effort required from you.

App Service Helpers was developed as a supplemental library to Microsoft's Azure Client SDK.

Mike James and Pierce Boggan,2016-09-16T19:49:46.15Z,43209,581,"App Service Helpers (ASH) makes it as easy as possible to add data storage and authentication to your mobile app with Microsoft's Azure App Service Platform. ASH was built with the mobile developer in mind, and requires no previous experience with backends as a service (BaaS).

In just four lines of code, you can connect your app to the cloud with online/offline synchronization and automatic conflict resolution. Authenticating users with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft accounts, Azure AD, and Azure B2C is dead simple as well - just one line of code.
