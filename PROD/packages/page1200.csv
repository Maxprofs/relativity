WebMarkupMin absorbed the best of existing solutions from non-microsoft platforms: Juriy Zaytsev's Experimental HTML Minifier (http://github.com/kangax/html-minifier/) (written in JavaScript) and Sergiy Kovalchuk's HtmlCompressor (http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/) (written in Java).

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C). The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://github.com/PureKrome/YUICompressor.NET).

Matthew S. Dippel,2015-11-20T23:10:29.46Z,643,882,"Enums and Delegates are a fundimental component of .Net, however, as of version 6.0 of the C# language, there's no way to (directly) constrain a generic parameter to System.Enum or System.Delegate. There's so many reasons to want to do so, not the least of which is the set of kludgy static methods on Enum and Delegate that would really benefit from generic implementations.

This package addresses that need.  Written in C++/CLI since C# cannot declare an enum or delegate restriction, this library provides a set of well performing extension and static methods off of the ""Diagonactic.Enums"" class that provide a more readable way of performing common operations on enums and delegates, all of which can be consumed by C# code.

Enum methods are stable, Delegate methods are considered ""Beta"".  As a result, the API for Delegate methods may be modified (Obsolete tags for invalid members will be added if this happens), though every effort will be made to avoid this.  Enum methods are API stable, however, methods are added occasionally.

All stable methods are unit tested for all underlying types with complete code coverage.

      These features leave no chance to mistypings or problems arising from db entity refactorings.

      The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project.
      There is no need to target .NET 4.6, but it is mandatory to use VS2015 or an equivalent build environment.
      For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

      ----------

      - Composite primary keys are supported

      - All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
      - Fast pre-computed entity queries
      - A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
      - A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.

      These features leave no chance to mistypings or problems arising from db entity refactorings.

      The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project.
      There is no need to target .NET 4.6, but it is mandatory to use VS2015 or an equivalent build environment.
      For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

      Features:
      ----------
      - Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
      - Composite primary keys are supported
      - Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
      - All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
      - Fast pre-computed entity queries
      - A useful SQL builder and statement formatter which can be used even if you don't need the CRUD features of this library.
      - A generic T4 template for C# is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
      Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes, have their mappings programmatically set, or using your own custom convention.
