      Included interfaces with abstractions:

      1. **IDbFactory** is a simple interface that you register with your IoC. It can create/spwan ISession's and IUntOfWork's. But primary used in code to spawn sessions.
      2. **ISession<TDatabase>** (and Session<TDatabase> abstraction):	Extends IDbConnection. You use it to extend your Database connection / Session type. Yours session classes and interfaces require a connection string. So If you have multiple database connections, you need 1 ISession and Session extended Interface and class per database. When the session is created by the factory it connects to the database, when it disposes it discontects and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the session for any IDbConnection or dapper (or extension) framework you like, as ISession extends IDbConnection ;-).
      3. **IUnitOfWork** (and UnitOfWork): Extends IDbTransaction. You don't need to extend anything with this. When you have created a session in you code, you can create a uow from the session. Then the session is created by the factory it begins a transaction (isolation i a parameter), when it disposes it commits (roleback on exception) and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the transaction for any IDbTransaction work you like as IUnitOfWork extends IDbConnection ;-).
      4. **IRepository<TSession, TEntity, TPk>** (Repository<TSession, TEntity, TPk> abstraction):	Is a default repository that you extend with your own repository for each of the entities you want a repository for. There as some built in methods for GetAll, Get, and SaveOrUpdate. You can add the methods you need for your entity using any IDbConnection framework. I have used [dapper-dot-net](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) and [dapper.FastCRUD](https://github.com/MoonStorm/Dapper.FastCRUD) for the quering.
      5. **IEntity<TPk>**: An interface for your Entities so FastCRUD GetKey works in Repositories. To use this your table / entity should always have and Id column as Pk in what every type you like (its a generic :-).
      6. **IRepositoryBase** (and RepositoryBase<TEntity> abstraction):	This is a vanilla base repository, you can use it if you do not want to use Dapper or Dapper.FastCRUD and/or IEntity interface.

Also i wanted the usage of the session and uow to become nice and simple.  
This should cover 97% of your needs. But i have also insured the the Session and UoW types extend the ADO base interfaces, so you can basically do anything you like with the session / uow, because they are IDbConnection and IDbTransaction. 

I have tried to insure it is as bare bones as possible. Only adding the system libraries needed and Dapper + Dapper.FASTCrud. The IoC of your choice is not included in the package, 
but i have made example registrations for the ""majors"" look on the project site.

      The library gives you the building blocks to:
      * Create Sessions from the IDbFactory in your methods, IDbFactory should be injected into your class's. As Session extends IDbConnection and will Open on the factory spawning the session and dispose the connection on disposal of the connection.
      * Your Sessions can create UnitOfWork's. As Session extends IDbConnection and will Open on the factory spawning the session and dispose the connection on disposal of the connection.
      * If your logic just needs ""just a"" UnitOfWork with a session that has the same scope, the factory can create it for you.
      * The IRepository and abstract concrete class should be used on your individual repository classes to provide simple and basic calls. But ofcasue you can add all the queries you want into your Repositories and use the dapper and dapper.FastCRUD (or any other extensions) functionality provided to you.
      * The repository abstract classes use Dapper.FastCRUD to give you a fluent ORM experience with the most common calls.
      * This library does not lock you to using dapper and FastCRUD, you can use any library you like that extends IDbConnection and IDbTransation, and still use the IDbFactory, ISession and IUnitOrWork.

Ventura is the hyper productive alternative for the Entity Framework/Web service combination. Clients are available for UWP (Win10 Apps), WPF, WinForms, iOS (Xamarin) and Android (Xamarin). The middle-tier (server) runs on ASP.Net.

Ventura is an extremely easy to use solution where you provide an Sql statement, and then source code is automatically generated for all clients and the middle-tier. Ventura scales from development teams building enterprise applications to individual developers. 

The WPF, WinForms and ASP.Net clients can also connect directly to Sql Server without middle-tier.

Ventura is developed for Microsoft Sql Server, other DBMSes are not supported.
