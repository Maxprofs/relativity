Xamarin Inc.,2015-12-17T20:32:02.17Z,30,855,"UrhoSharp is a lightweight Game Engine suitable for using with C# and F# to create games that run on Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Unix. The game engine is available as a portable class library, allowing your game code to be written once and shared across all platforms. UrhoSharp is powered by Urho3D (http://urho3d.github.io/), a game engine that has been under development for more than a decade.   All the samples from Urho3D have been ported to C# to help you get started:

https://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples

Among the features of the Urho3D you will find:


•	Direct3D9, Direct3D11, OpenGL 2.0 or 3.2 or OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering
•	HLSL or GLSL shaders + caching of HLSL bytecode
•	Configurable rendering pipeline. Default implementations for forward, light pre-pass and deferred rendering
•	Component based scene model
•	Skeletal (with hardware skinning), vertex morph and node animation
•	Automatic instancing on SM3 capable hardware
•	Point, spot and directional lights
•	Shadow mapping for all light types; cascaded shadow maps for directional lights
•	Particle rendering
•	Geomipmapped terrain
•	Static and skinned decals
•	Auxiliary view rendering (reflections etc.)
•	Geometry, material & animation LOD
•	Software rasterized occlusion culling
•	Post-processing
•	HDR renderingv1.31
•	2D sprites and particles that integrate into the 3D scenev1.31
•	Task-based multithreading
•	Hierarchical performance profiler
•	Scene and object load/save in binary and XML format
•	Keyframe animation of object attributes
•	Background loading of resources
•	Keyboard, mouse, joystick and touch input (if available)
•	Physics using Bullet
•	2D physics using Box2D
•	Networking using kNet + possibility to make HTTP requests
•	Pathfinding and crowd simulation using Recast/Detour
•	Image loading using stb_image + DDS / KTX / PVR compressed texture support
•	2D and “3D” audio playback, Ogg Vorbis support using stb_vorbis + WAV format support
•	TrueType font rendering using FreeType, AngelCode bitmap fonts are also supported
•	Unicode string support
•	Inbuilt UI system
•	Scene editor and UI-layout editor implemented in script with undo & redo capabilities
•	Model/scene/animation/material import from formats supported by Open Asset Import Library
•	Alternative model/animation import from OGRE mesh.xml and skeleton.xml files",UrhoSharp,False,2018-03-21T15:52:37.217+00:00,True,False,"Cross Platform, 2D and 3D Game Engine for C# (Android, iOS, Windows, Mac).","Urho,Urho3D,UrhoSharp,Xamarin,2D,3D,games,engine",38209,True,1.0.264
