      Included types:
      === NonBlocking.ConcurrentDictionary
      Lock-free, wait-free implementation of a dictionary.
      - has the same API as System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary.
      - No locks are taken during any operation including Get, Add, Remove, internal resizes etc...
      - While multiple threads accessing NonBlocking dictionary will help each other in operations such as table resizing, there is no dependency on such behavior. If any thread get unscheduled or delayed for whatever reason, other threads will be able to make progress independently.
      - NonBlocking dictionary scales linearly with the number of active threads if hardware permits.

      On most operations NonBlocking dictionary is faster than Concurrent, especially in write-heavy scenarios.

      There is a subtle difference in the behavior of Remove. Concurrent dictionary removes both the value and the key on Remove, while holding a lock. NonBlocking dictionary only removes values, thus avoiding locking, and the corresponding key is dropped lazily when more space is needed. In code that relies on deterministic removal of key objects (uncommon), Concurrent dictionary would be preferable.

      Core algorithms are based on NonBlockingHashMap, written and released to the public domain by Dr. Cliff Click. A good overview could be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ-719EGIts

Vladimir Sadov,2017-05-10T18:25:40.96Z,90,345,"      Implementation of a lock-free dictionary on .Net

      Included types:
      === NonBlocking.ConcurrentDictionary
      Lock-free, wait-free implementation of a dictionary.
      - has the same API as System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary.
      - No locks are taken during any operation including Get, Add, Remove, internal resizes etc...
      - While multiple threads accessing NonBlocking dictionary will help each other in operations such as table resizing, there is no dependency on such behavior. If any thread get unscheduled or delayed for whatever reason, other threads will be able to make progress independently.
      - NonBlocking dictionary scales linearly with the number of active threads if hardware permits.

      On most operations NonBlocking dictionary is faster than Concurrent especially in write-heavy scenarios.

      There is a subtle difference in the behavior of Remove. Concurrent dictionary removes both the value and the key on Remove, while holding a lock. NonBlocking dictionary only removes values, thus avoiding locking, and the corresponding key is dropped lazily when more space is needed. In code that relies on deterministic removal of key objects (uncommon), Concurrent dictionary would be preferable.

      Core algorithms are based on NonBlockingHashMap, written and released to the public domain by Dr. Cliff Click. A good overview could be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ-719EGIts

        Concurrent dictionary removes both the value and the key on Remove, while holding a lock. NonBlocking dictionary only removes values, thus avoiding locking, and the corresponding key is dropped lazily when more space is needed.
        In code that relies on deterministic removal of key objects (uncommon), Concurrent dictionary would be preferrable.
        
        Core algorithms are based on NonBlockingHashMap, written and released to the public domain by Dr. Cliff Click.

"nuu:bit,Inc.",2017-05-10T15:25:51.74Z,344,345,"The nuu:bit Xamarin Mobile SDK is a simple way to connect a Xamarin mobile application to the nuu:bit's global content acceleration and analytics platform.

The nuu:bit Mobile SDK  is a set of libraries that provide the means necessary to report and accelerate the delivery of content to applications running on mobile devices. The nuu:bit SDK utilizes a specially designed set of networking protocols to provide acceleration to a given mobile application.  Network traffic that is normally directed to and from the mobile App is sent through the nuu:bit SDK, which utilizes the nuu:bit global network to accelerate the App’s traffic.

The SDK can function utilizing  either one of two nuu:bit-optimized protocols – an UDP-based protocol NMP (nuu:bit Mobile Protocol) or TCP-based protocol DOTS (Dynamically Optimized Transport System) to transfer the content over the wireless network. The SDK determines, which protocol provides better performance for that particular App, device, and wireless network at that moment in time. Once the appropriate protocol is selected, the protocol then identifies network, device and App conditions, and adapts its own behavior in real time to provide the fastest possible transfer of data overall.
The nuu:bit SDK communicates with the nuu:bit server in the nuu:bit network, maintaining the flow of content, and monitoring and reporting on the operation of the SDK while sending performance data reflecting data transfer rates, bandwidth, latencies, etc. The raw data  is then forwarded to nuu:bit log servers, and processed for reporting purposes. Processed data is then forwarded to the nuu:bit analytics backend  service, where the performance information is made available to nuu:bit customers via the API or portal.
