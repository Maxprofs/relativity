Implementing client side localization into any web application is always challenge. Most of web technologies provide localization using server-side technologies. For e.g. .Net application uses Resources Files(.resx) to implement localization into globalize application. 

Nowadays world is extensively moving towards Asynchronous development models like AJAX / SPA. Several frameworks, libraries are already available on the web. To access these server side resources requires custom REST services / handlers to be additionally implemented into the host application. 

This plugin makes life easier where you can manage all your localized resources into plain Text or JavaScript file. Based on current culture provided to this plugin, it loads associated resource entries for use. To enhance performance it uses Cache mechanication for subsequent Initialization calls. So now no more server side development required for managing locationzation. It can be used in any web applications like SharePoint On-Premise / Online, Php, ASP.Net MVC, JAVA and many more as long as these technologies supports JavaScript.",PritamBaldota.JqueryResourceLocalization,False,2015-10-24T03:55:35.153+00:00,True,False,"Create client side (JavaScript) based Resource Localization in any web application.

MoonStorm,2015-05-29T16:45:43.193Z,1,1057,"The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the code contains the polyfills for the missing FormattableString class, which is required when targetting that framework version and using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.EntityGeneration.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.

MoonStorm,2015-05-28T22:11:43.897Z,1,1058,"The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the code contains the polyfills for the missing FormattableString class, which is required when targetting that framework version and using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience. Entity domain partitioning and generation can be achieved via separate template configurations.
The installation package includes a sample config file SampleModelGeneratorConfig.tt which you can rename and tweak at will. 
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.
