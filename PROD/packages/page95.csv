You can add tables to the database by calling db.CreateTable<T> where T is the type of entity to be stored in table rows.  You can save either all tables by calling SaveAsync on database or one table at a time by calling SaveAsync on a specific table.  It supports await and async keywords.  As of version 0.9.1.0 it supports data binding to list based controls, such as ListBox.
