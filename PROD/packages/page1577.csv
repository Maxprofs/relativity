Clockwork is a complete programming paradigm that lets you model and execute complex business processes. In Clockwork you write Gears that encapsulate specific business steps. Then you write code to assemble Gears together to compose complete business processes called Mechanisms. A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching existing Mechanisms and Gears you have already in your library.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.
