**Examples**:

- Create dynamic test data and refer it in another step

When enter [[var=50]] //assign 50 to a variable named ""var""

Then [[var]] equals 50 // now get variable ""var"" value

- Create dynamic test data using regular expression

When enter [[var=RegEx([0-9]{3})]] //assign var with 3 digit random number

Then [[var]] is a 3 digits number // now get variable ""var"" value

- Same applies to SpecFlow tables:
 	When create new user with the following details:
     |Field   | Value                                 |
     |UserName| [[name=RegEx([a-z]{5,8})]]            |	        
	 |Password| [[pwd=RegEx([a-z]{3}[0-9]{3})]]       |
	Then verify can login with username=""[[name]]"" and password=""[[pwd]]"" 

 - Support customerise transformation

     for example, you want to map Today to YYYY:MM:dd, add the following code in one of your Specflow steps 
	 or put it in BeforeScenario step.
      ((IParameterTransform)
                (ScenarioContext.Current.GetBindingInstance(typeof(IParameterTransform))))
            .addTransformer(s => s.ToLower() == today ? DateTime.Now.ToString(""yyyy/MM/dd"") : s); 
	
     Now in Specflow feature files, you can write:	
	 When entered ""[[timeVar=Today]]""		  //timeVar will be assigned to yyyy/MM/dd, e.g 2017/12/04
