Scope Change (Based on aspects)

-   Kept:

    -   Common contracts and entity interfaces.

    -   AOP

    -   Restful API

    -   Reflection

    -   Http enhancements and extension. (System.Web based classes is supported in .NET framework only.)

    -   Sandbox and dynamic compiling.

    -   Data access controller (for Microsoft SQL Server)

-   New:

    -   HttpRequestMessage + HttpResponseMessage supports.

-   Removed:

    -   System.Draw based.

    -   Win Form/WPF UI based.

    -   LDAP extension.

To support .NET core 2.0, common is refined to supported 4.6.2 first. Meanwhile, regarding unavoidable incompatibility between .NET framework and .NET
core, implementation and scope have to be changed to meet goal.

 

Scope Change (Based on aspects)

-   Kept:

    -   Common contracts and entity interfaces.

    -   AOP

    -   Restful API

    -   Reflection

    -   Http enhancements and extension. (System.Web based classes is supported in .NET framework only.)

    -   Sandbox and dynamic compiling.

    -   Data access controller (for Microsoft SQL Server)

-   New:

    -   HttpRequestMessage + HttpResponseMessage supports.

-   Removed:

    -   System.Draw based.

    -   Win Form/WPF UI based.

    -   LDAP extension.

-   As new library:
