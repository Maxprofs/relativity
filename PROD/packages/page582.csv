      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Mono for Android
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args))
      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
      - Supports fluent syntax
