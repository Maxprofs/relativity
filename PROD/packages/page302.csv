One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.

MicroMVVM fetches the exportable ViewModels found within an application and attaches each ViewModel to the corresponding View. 

Inversion of Control
MicroMVVM leverages the Dependency Injection pattern, the framework fetches Transient and Singleton exportable services and injects these interfaces in the ViewModel's constructor.

Navigation
MicroMVVM.Navigation allows an easy way to navigate from one view to another from the ViewModels. Also provides the means to pass complex objects from one view to another.

Services
IConnectionService and ILayoutService are available in MicroMVVM.Services to notify the application when the internet connection has been lost and when the application layout has changed. IStorageFileService and IToastMessageService are available to access the files found in the roaming folder and to show toast messages.
