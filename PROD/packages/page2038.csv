E-iceblue,2016-12-05T07:06:56.923Z,10,501,"Spire.Doc for .NET, specially designed for developers, enables to fast generate, open, write, edit and save Word document from Word Version 97-2003 to 2013. The featured function conversion enables developers to easily realize conversion between Word and other popular document formats such as Word to PDF/EPub/HTML/RTF/Image/XML etc.

Spire.Doc for .NET is a totally independent .NET Word class library which doesn't require Microsoft Office installed on system. Microsoft Office Automation is proved to be unstable, slow and not scalable to produce MS Word documents. Spire.Doc for .NET is many times faster than Microsoft Word Automation and with much better stability and scalability. 

By using Spire.Doc for .NET, users can save Word Doc/Docx to stream, save as web response and convert Word Doc/Docx to XML, RTF, EMF, TXT, XPS, EPUB, HTML and vice versa. Spire.Doc for .NET also supports to convert Word Doc/Docx to PDF and HTML to image.
