Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-16T15:19:25.563Z,549,643,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

The coming sample XAML project will give an example of how to implement via bindings.

Usage:
    xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

    <roxv:VideoView AutoPlay=""True"" LoopPlay=""True"" ShowController=""True"" VideoSource=""http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4"" />

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Common Questions:
 Q: Why is the pcl named "".Portable""?
 A: There is a .NETStandardv1.4 version ready to go, I am just waiting to see what happens with ""project.json"".

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?
 A: You can have all the profits made from this component. So, no Tim, you don't.

 Q: Would you like another coffee?
 A: Don't ask, give.

What people are saying about the VideoView control:
 - ""It is awesome"" -me
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about"" -random guy on the street
 - ""I wanna punch that rabbit in the head"" - my brother
 - ""That's nice, dear"" -my mum
 - ""It's better than Lego"" -me
 - ""But I can already watch p0rn on my phone"" -name withheld (see I didn't tell them your name, Gav)
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about, and NO! I do not want to go back to your place and make our own video, creep."" -random girl on the street
 - ""I am pretty sure this will revolutionise the IT industry"" -me
 - ""If you don't shut up I will punch YOU in the head"" - my brother
 - ""What do you mean by a zammering video? Sounds like something I can't click on at work."" - Sid

Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-16T12:30:13.87Z,549,643,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

The coming sample XAML project will give an example of how to implement.

Usage:
    xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

    <roxv:VideoView AutoPlay=""True"" LoopPlay=""True"" ShowController=""True"" VideoSource=""http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4"" />

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)
