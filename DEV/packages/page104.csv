In addition, you can also install translator-modules that implement the translation of code on intermediate languages (LESS, Sass, SCSS, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Mustache (by using Hogan) and Handlebars).

The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases. While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program. Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties, observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators. When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.",FsCheck,False,2015-12-17T14:11:52.04-08:00,True,False,FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically using randomly generated test cases.,"test,testing,random,fscheck,quickcheck",70364,False,1.0.3
