"Nathanael Jones,Imazen",2015-07-07T18:14:06.41Z,926,1036,"Lightweight HttpModule, REST API, and managed API for *safe* and highly-optimized server-side image processing. 

Docs: http://imageresizing.net/

Support: http://imageresizing.net/support

Works with .NET 4.5.1+, ASP.NET WebForms, MVC 1-4, WebAPI, Routing, IIS 7, 7.5, & 8, 8.1 and nearly all CMSes.

Use ether the URL API: image.jpg?width=100&height=100 *or* the Managed API: ImageBuilder.Current.Build(source,dest,settings).

ImageResizer provides incredible quality and highly-optimized image processing - by default. Don't leak memory by using System.Drawing directly or create horrible previews with GetThumbnailImage. Add the ImageResizer.Plugins.DiskCache package to serve dynamic images as fast as static ones. 

With this library, you can create beautiful image galleries, product thumbnails, and fast, scalable websites *without* sacrificing agility or responsive web design.

## Functionality in this package

The ImageResizer core package lets you: 

1. Decode jpeg, png, gif, tiff, and bmp files from uploads, streams, byte arrays, and files. 

2. Pre-rotate or flip (based on gravity sensor OR manual angle).

3. Apply manual cropping in either source or screen coordinates.

4. Efficiently apply width and/or height constraints, using any of several constraint modes: max, pad, crop, or stretch. Provides the highest quality image resampling (bicubic 2-pass) available on the windows platform.

5. Rotate, flip, add borders, padding, margins, with custom colors.

3. Re-compress into jpeg (with adjustable compression) or lossless png form -  as a byte array, stream, or file.

All through a REST API and Managed API with a symmetrical command set. 

URL rewriting, custom authorization, 404 fallbacks, gradient generation, exif stripping, size limiting, and cache-control customization are also included in the core DLL.

## 30+ plugins available

Search 'ImageResizer' on nuget.org, or visit imageresizing.net to see 40+ plugins. Some offer 4-30x performance improvements; some render PDFs and PSDs; others detect faces and trim whitespace.
You'll find  plugins for disk caching, memory caching, Microsoft SQL blob support, Amazon CloudFront, S3, Azure Blob Storage, MongoDB GridFS, automatic whitespace trimming, automatic white balance, octree 8-bit gif/png quantization and transparency dithering, animated gif resizing, watermark & text overlay support, content aware image resizing / seam carving (based on CAIR), grayscale, sepia, histogram, alpha, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, Guassian blur, noise removal, and smart sharpen filters, psd editing & rendering, raw (CR2, NEF, DNG, etc.) file exposure, .webp (weppy) support, image batch processing & compression into .zip archives, red eye auto-correction,  face detection, and secure (signed!) remote HTTP image processing. Most datastore plugins support the Virtual Path Provider system, and can be used for non-image files as well.



## Third-party integration

WebSupergoo,2015-07-10T09:49:21.83Z,887,1033,"ABCpdf is a powerful and flexible PDF component for .NET.

ABCpdf is a .NET component for PDF manipulation. As such, you'll find it documented for C# and VB.NET, with numerous PDF code examples and freely adaptable projects, all designed to help you get up to speed.

Re-use existing skills for PDF document layout. ABCpdf supports a wide range of layout methods, including HTML and CSS, System.Drawing, PostScript, and a powerful set of native drawing commands. Import SVG, DOCX, XPS, EPS, the usual bitmap image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, PSD and many more. And because support for these formats is built-in, ABCpdf makes light work of PDF related document conversion tasks.

Import HTML and CSS pages from local or remote web sites. Placed HTML support means your HTML can be treated just like any other media - placed wherever you like on your PDF page. Choose between the FireFox and Internet Explorer HTML rendering engines. A vast range of options gives you full control over the HTML rendering process and DOM.

ABCpdf is a robust component, with probably hundreds of thousands of live installations, and more than a decade's worth of support and development. But should you ever need help our PDF expert support team are on hand.

ABCpdf is fast. ABCpdf does not use a printer driver. Instead it goes Direct to PDF™, generating PDF documents on the fly. And fully multi-threaded, ABCpdf is suitable for use with ASP.NET.

ABCpdf supports Unicode and foreign languages, CJK fonts, and right-to-left text such as Arabic and Hebrew, kerning, tracking and contextual ligatures.

ABCpdf supports sophisticated color spaces. Mix and match RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, calibrated color spaces and spot colors. Any kind of graphic from text to lines to blocks of color can be drawn in in any of these color spaces. You can even perform complex operations like colorizing grayscale images using spot colors or converting from one color space to another.

PDF optimization and size reduction provides whole document optimization using a variety of options to reduce font sizes, remove embedded fonts, to resample and recompress images, to flatten wherever possible for the smallest possible output.

PDF analysis has been extended into easy-to-use operations for text and images. Simple on the surface but sophisticated underneath, they allow you to extract common-sense, de-hyphenated and de-ligatured text from PDFs. Then select items of that text within the PDF and perform operations on those selections.

PDF accessibility is now something that can be supported, even for PDFs which were never designed to do so. Standards such as PDF/UA and Section 508 compliance require that PDFs be accessible. Our accessibility operation performs a sophisticated semantic analysis of the document content and adds appropriate tagging information to produce an accessible Tagged PDF output.
