		MvcMailer has a MailerBase class that extends ControllerBase class. So, Mailers are just like your Controllers.
		As a result, you can use all the controller goodies without any learning curve, period. The end result
		is a professional looking HTML email body ready for your to send to your website users.

		Here's a quick list of features:
		a) Use Razor/WebForms views
		b) Use Master pages
		c) Write Testable Code

SpecExpress doesn't use Attributes to decorate properties and embed all the metadata required for the rule. Instead, it it uses a separate class, called a Specification, which contains a set a rules for all the properties for a type. This allows for much easier reading, separation of concerns, and much better support for state based validation. 

Features include: DSL that provides developers with a Fluent Interface for quickly composing rules that are also easy to read;    Generates error message from your validation rules, while allowing for easy overriding and customization of individual messages; Support for localization of error messages;
Auto discovery of specifications means the developer isn't required to resolve which validation rules to use;      Programatically add or change validation rules at runtime; Validation Contexts Support for rich, complex object types and graphs; Built with extension and customization in mind; Easy to integrate into your existing code because there are no Base Classes or Attributes to inject into your code; ASP.NET WebForms support; Silverlight support; A rich set of Validators.",SpecExpress,False,2014-08-03T13:13:15.097-07:00,True,A fluent validation framework and container for .Net that makes it easier to write validation rules and validate your objects.,,15034,False,1.5.0
