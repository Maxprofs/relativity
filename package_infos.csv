The first tool in the suite was PsList, a tool that lets you view detailed information about processes, and the suite is continually growing. The ""Ps"" prefix in PsList relates to the fact that the standard UNIX process listing command-line tool is named ""ps"", so I've adopted this prefix for all the tools in order to tie them together into a suite of tools named PsTools.
