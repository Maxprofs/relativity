InjectionMap supports .Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 or higher and Windows Store apps for Windows 8 or higher.

- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. 
- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.
- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.
- The desired Constructors can be marked with attributes or will be selected according to the passed arguments.
- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping as objects or as delegate expressions.
- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.
