Class namespace:rtChart;

Class contains only one public method and field.
In the constructor you have to pass name of the chart and array size which holds data for redrawing chart.
Ex.
kayChart kChart = new kayChart(chart1,60);

Then create method which supply data for chart.Method needs to return double.

private double DataForChart(){
{
Random rnd = new Random();
return rnd.Next(0,1000);
}
To get it working you have to pass that method  to UpdateChart()

Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
kChart.UpdateChart(DataForChart(),1000);
}
Where 1000 is refresh time.

the thread (the processing is scheduled on a worker thread instead).
