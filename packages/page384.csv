.NET Framework Recommended during Preview:
At this time, applications looking to use the Windows Azure Management Libraries should use the .NET Framework. Management operations require the X509Certificate2 type that is not present in the Portable Class Library API surface area. The Common.NetFramework library exposes this functionality. Looking to the future, we are enabling PCL early: Windows Azure Active Directory integration enables token-based authentication. Coupled with appropriate platform-specific libraries, in the future more platforms will light up with support for managing Windows Azure services.

      It is the base for modules as micro-services. There are two concepts: The chains and the actions.
      The chains act like a state machine representation of the class, holding a context, which actions can be applied. While actions are applied either the data or context returned might change.
      Using common patterns over this methodology small components can be build that can be easily testable and injectable through each other.
