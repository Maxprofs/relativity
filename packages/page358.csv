The SDK provides more than 50 pre-made filters and effects that have been specifically developed for mobile imaging, with speed and memory performance as key drivers. The SDK is highly optimized to be super-fast by meticulous memory and code optimization. The patented JPEG technology, RAJPEG, contributes to making this possible, as it allows access to any image data without decoding the whole image. That means you can apply effects to high resolution images, without worrying about your memory budget.

      It is the base for modules as micro-services. There are two concepts: The chains and the actions.

      Using common patterns over this methodology small components can be build that can be easily testable and injectable through each other.
