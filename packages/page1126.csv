Yan Cui,2015-10-07T01:48:47.27Z,"A SQL-like external DSL for querying and scanning data in Amazon DynamoDB.

      Although there exists a number of different ways to query and scan a DynamoDB table with the
      .Net AWS SDK:

      - with the low-level AmazonDynamoDBClient class
      - with the Table helper class
      - with the DynamoDBContext class

      none of these ways of querying and scanning tables are easy to use, and an external DSL is
      desperately needed to make it easier to express the query one would like to perform against
      data stored in DynamoDB.

      It is because of these limitations that I decided to add a SQL-like external DSL on top of
      existing functionalities of the AWS SDK to make it easier for .Net developers to work with
      DynamoDB, which is a great product despite the lack of built-in support for a good

            SimpleList: For small lists, the UI of the built-in ListView leaves a lot to be desired.  You can use a StackLayout, but then you lose the ability to have an ItemTemplate and ItemSelectedCommand.
                        That's what SimpleList was made for - it gives you the UI control of the StackLayout with the functionality of a ListView.
                        SimpleList is not nearly as performant as ListView, so please don't use it for large lists of data!

This is the ""runtime"" or ""redist"" EventSource package and should be referenced directly only by other NuGet packages that need the EventSource functionality. Application developers that need this functionality should instead reference the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource NuGet package which provides an enhanced developer experience.

      This package enables defining a strongly typed specification of an ETW provider that can be called by managed code. The EventSource class is also included in the .NET Framework. This package provides a newer version that has more features. It is meant to be used as a stop gap until those features it contains are ported to System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.

      For more details, have a look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx.
