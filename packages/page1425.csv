To run tests that use dotMemory Unit, you should reference the dotMemory.Unit assembly (which is a part of this package) from your test project.
Tests with the support for dotMemory Unit can be run either with a standalone unit test runner of your choice or with the ReSharper unit test runner.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options
  * Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict, Section 508 and WCAG AAA compliant markup
  * Visual Studio .NET 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 and 2003 Designer support
  * Medium trust environment support for shared servers
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP.NET MVC 4, ASP.NET MVC 3, ASP.NET MVC 2, and ASP.NET MVC 1 applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET WebForms applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET Ajax and jQuery Ajax validation

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options
  * Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict, Section 508 and WCAG AAA compliant markup
  * Visual Studio .NET 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 and 2003 Designer support
  * Medium trust environment support for shared servers
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP.NET MVC 4, ASP.NET MVC 3, ASP.NET MVC 2, and ASP.NET MVC 1 applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET WebForms applications
