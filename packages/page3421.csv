Colby C.,2016-05-19T07:13:13.927Z,669,701,"A goal seek algorithm written in C#.

Using three points of input (the trident) at a time, the algorithm takes a stab (three guesses) and analyses the output values. The tine (value) which is the closest to the goal output value, becomes the new center stab point and the tine spacing is increased. When the center tine is the closest to the output value, the tine spacing is reduced and the trident stab repeats until an output value is within the acceptance threshold.

 
*** Usage ***

Your algorithm needs to implement the IGoalSeekAlgorithm interface.

The usage is as follows:

    var myAlgorithm = new MyAlgorithm(90463.45M, 200);
    var goalSeeker = new GoalSeek(myAlgorithm);
    var seekResult = goalSeeker.SeekResult(96178.21M);

 
*** Output ***

The GoalSeekResult has 4 properties.

InputVariable: This number is the answer you are looking for. This is the number that was determined by the algorithm to get you to your specified goal value.

OutputValue: This number represents what goal value the algorithm managed to get to. This output value may not match the goal specified, either because of the acceptance criteria, the algorithm, or the parameters passed to the SeekResult() method.

StabAttempts: This represents the number of times the algorithm had to take a 'stab' of input values to work toward the goal output value. This is purely informational.
