The goal is to have an easy-to-use and uniform yet modular and pluggable facility to handle common cross-cutting concerns in my applications, thereby freeing me up to focus on the actual application concerns and hopefully making it easier and faster to build them.
      In general, the library consists of interfaces or SPIs along with ways to access them (using MEF). One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.
