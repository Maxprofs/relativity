      Portable.Licensing.Prime is using the latest military strength, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithm
      to ensure that your software and thus your intellectual property is protected.

      It is targeting the Portable Class Library and thus runs on nearly every .NET/Mono profile
      including Silverlight, Windows Phone, Windows Store App, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac
      and XBox 360. Use it for your Desktop- (WinForms, WPF, etc.), Console-, Service-,
      Web- (ASP.NET, MVC, etc.), Mobile (Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android) or even LightSwitch applications.
