It is a productive library for manipulating image data captured and stored by mobile devices in an efficient way. The features include decoding and encoding JPEG images, applying filters, cropping, rotating and resizing. The SDK provides more than 50 pre-made filters and effects that have been specifically developed for mobile imaging, with speed and memory performance as key drivers. The SDK is highly optimized to be super-fast by meticulous memory and code optimization. The patented JPEG technology, RAJPEG, contributes to making this possible, as it allows access to any image data without decoding the whole image. That means you can apply effects to high resolution images, without worrying about your memory budget.

We have created MSNRemoteAB testing to address these problems.

Using a remote configuration file that gets checked at start up you are able to increase and decrease the number of users who receive the new feature.",MNSRemoteAB,False,2014-04-10T03:40:44.26-07:00,True,False,Remote configuration and A/B Testing framework for .net Applications,"testing,A/B,ABTesting,remote,config,configurator,wp8,wp8dev,windowsphone,store,app",588,False,1.1.1
