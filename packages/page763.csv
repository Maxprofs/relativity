This is a convenient WinRT API for making Internet connection state decisions in real time, using the speed result to decide if/when to run your network-intensive code. This is all about speed and latency, so you will need to test throughput if that is important to your application. This API does not need to eat a bunch of network bandwidth to do it's job.

      Supports the following as typed operations:

      > CheckGenerateToken - create a token automatically via an ITokenProvider
      > Query<T> - query a layer by attribute and / or spatial filters
      > QueryForCount - only return the number of results for the query operation
      > QueryForIds - only return the ObjectIds for the results of the query operation
      > Find - search across n layers and fields in a service
      > ApplyEdits<T> - post adds, updates and deletes to a feature service layer
      > Geocode - single line of input to perform a geocode using a custom locator or the Esri world locator
      > Suggest - lightweight geocode operation that only returns text results, commonly used for predictive searching
      > ReverseGeocode - find location candidates for an input point location
      > Simplify<T> - alter geometries to be topologically consistent
      > Project<T> - convert geometries to a different spatial reference
      > Buffer<T> - buffers geometries by the distance requested
      > DescribeSite - returns a url for every service discovered, for ArcGISOnline or Portal this returns the hosted feature services for a user
      > Ping - verify that the server can be accessed

      REST admin operations:

      > PublicKey - admin operation to get public key used for encryption of token requests
      > ServiceStatus - admin operation to get the configured and actual status of a service
      > ServiceReport - admin operation to get the service report
      > StartService - admin operation to start a service
