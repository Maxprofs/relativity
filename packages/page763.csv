2. No client-side installation required. Users can view and annotate any document from any device that has a web-browser with HTML5 support. So, no need for Acrobat Reader, for example, when annotating PDF documents.

3. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library comes with a comprehensive set of commenting tools, which allow end users to highlight, strikethrough, mark up text within a document, draw freehand lines, add sticky notes and comment on images. Annotated documents can be printed, exported to PDF and downloaded right from your web app.

4. Support for more than 45 file formats! With a single DLL, you can provide your app's users with the capability to annotate the following types of documents:

- Portable Document Format: PDF
- Microsoft Word: DOC, DOCX, DOCM, DOT, DOTX, DOTM
- Microsoft Excel: XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, XML
- Microsoft PowerPoint: PPT, PPTX
- Microsoft Visio: VSD, VDX, VSS, VSX, VST, VTX, VSDX, VDW
- Microsoft Project: MPP, MPT
- Microsoft Outlook: MSG, EML
- OpenDocument Formats: ODT, OTT, ODS, ODP
- Rich Text Format: RTF
