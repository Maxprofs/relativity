E-iceblue,2017-07-06T03:22:22.203Z,10,288,"Spire.Doc for .NET, specially designed for developers, enables to fast generate, open, write, edit and save Word document from Word Version 97-2003 to 2013. The featured function conversion enables developers to easily realize conversion between Word and other popular document formats such as Word to PDF/EPub/HTML/RTF/Image/XML etc.

Spire.Doc for .NET is a totally independent .NET Word class library which doesn't require Microsoft Office installed on system. Microsoft Office Automation is proved to be unstable, slow and not scalable to produce MS Word documents. Spire.Doc for .NET is many times faster than Microsoft Word Automation and with much better stability and scalability. 

By using Spire.Doc for .NET, users can save Word Doc/Docx to stream, save as web response and convert Word Doc/Docx to XML, RTF, EMF, TXT, XPS, EPUB, HTML and vice versa. Spire.Doc for .NET also supports to convert Word Doc/Docx to PDF and HTML to image. 

A common use of Spire.Doc for .NET is to create Word document dynamically from scratch. Almost all Word document elements are supported. Mainly includes page, sections, headers, footers, footnotes, paragraphs, lists, tables, text, fields, hyperlinks, bookmarks, comments, images, styles, background settings, printing features, document settings and protection. Furthermore, drawing objects including shapes, textboxes, images, OLE objects and controls are supported as well. 

Spire.Doc for .NET enables developers to process pre-existing Word documents. It supports search and replace function, alignment, page break, fill field, document concatenate, document copy, print, complex and deeply nested mail merge, etc.",Spire.Doc,False,2018-04-10T06:30:58.277+00:00,True,False,Spire.Doc for .NET is a professional and powerful .NET Word library to process a large range of Word tasks in C# and Visual Basic for .NET (2.0/3.5/4.0/4.0 ClientProfile/4.5),"words,Word,TEXT,RTF,doc,docx,PDF,XPS,HTML,Image,XTML,word,document,EPUB",89780,False,5.9.51

Val Melamed,2017-07-06T01:38:26.047Z,29,288,"Features:
            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive properties (e.g. PII);
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
            * Built and tested with .NET 4.6.2.

Maximus5,2017-07-06T00:48:52.777Z,1,288,"ConEmu-Maximus5 (short for Console Emulator) is a handy and full featured Windows console window (local terminal) with a lot of enhancements: panes, tabs, tasks, jump lists, quake style, handy text and block selection, handy paste of paths in either Unix or Windows notation, and much more.

ConEmu.Core package contains only essential files - no extras, no Far Manager plugins, no documentation. Full distro and docs are available on the project site.

ConEmu may work as either standalone window, or embeddable console control. And it may host two types of applications:
* ‘console’: cmd, powershell, Far Manager, bash, and many others;
* ‘graphical’ (GUI): Notepad, PuTTY, GVim, mintty and so on.

Short list of features:
* predefined and user-defined tasks for different shells;
* user friendly text and block selection and paste;
* smooth and friendly window resizing;
* Windows 7 Jump Lists and Progress on Taskbar buttons;
* DosBox integration: run old DOS applications (games) in modern OS;
* quake-style and full screen window modes;
* ANSI sequences and Xterm 256 colors;
* cursor: standard console (horizontal) or GUI (vertical);
* customizable starting tabs;
* Far Manager integration: drag-n-drop, tabs, truecolor, thumbnails;
* unicode and CJK support;
* explore much more features on the project site.",ConEmu.Core,False,2018-04-19T10:54:53.393+00:00,True,False,ConEmu (short for Console Emulator) is a handy and full featured Windows console window (local terminal) with a lot of enhancements.,"graphical,console,emulator,tabs,farmanager,powershell,cmd,bash,cygwin,msys,git",20407,False,17.7.5
