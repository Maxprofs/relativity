Clockwork is a complete programming paradigm that lets you model and execute complex business processes via Gears that encapsulate specific business steps. Then you assemble those Gears together to compose a myriad of business processes called Mechanisms. A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching Mechanisms and Gears in the vast Clockwork library or those you already have for your private use.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.
