The main differences classes CssTransformer and JsTransformer from standard implementations: ability to exclude unnecessary assets when adding assets from a directory, does not produce the re-minification of code of pre-minified assets, support automatic transformation of relative paths to absolute in CSS-code (for CssTransformer), etc. These classes do not produce the minification of code in runtime, but this feature can be added by installing of minifier-adapter (now available adapters based on Microsoft Ajax Minifier, YUI Compressor for .NET, Google Closure Compiler, Douglas Crockford's JSMin, Mihai Bazon's UglifyJS, Dean Edwards' Packer, Sergey Kryzhanovsky's CSSO (CSS Optimizer) and WebGrease). In addition, you can also install translator-adapters that implement the translation of code on intermediate languages (LESS, Sass, SCSS, CoffeeScript and TypeScript).

PubNub removes the need for your client apps to constantly poll your cloud for new updates. So you can push data from a Server to a Client. And also you may push data from one Server to another Server, just like Azure ServiceBus ESB.

Another option is available for a Mobile Phone to Push Data to another Mobile Phone or any endpoint. With PubNub this becomes easy using the two basic Publish/Subscribe APIs.
