Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

Antonio Nakic Alfirevic,2015-08-22T06:53:47.32Z,"A library that makes it easier to persist and reapply application state (window locations and sizes, user settings and preferences, etc.). 

In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. 

The source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url). The article is a bit dated compared to the library code though.",Jot,False,2017-12-25T19:10:36.907+00:00,True,False,"A library for storing and reapplying application state (e.g. form sizes&locations, settings, user preferences etc).",".net,settings,state,persistence,wpf,winforms,asp.net,mvc",6399,False,1.2.2

Antonio Nakic Alfirevic,2015-08-22T06:57:47.52Z,"A library that makes it easier to persist and reapply application state (window locations and sizes, user settings and preferences, etc.). 

In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. 

The source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url). The article is a bit dated compared to the library code though.",Jot,False,2017-12-25T19:10:36.907+00:00,True,False,"A library for storing and reapplying application state (e.g. form sizes&locations, settings, user preferences etc).",".net,settings,state,persistence,wpf,winforms,asp.net,mvc",6399,False,1.2.3

Antonio Nakic Alfirevic,2015-08-22T06:52:07.17Z,"A library that makes it easier to persist and reapply application state (window locations and sizes, user settings and preferences, etc.). 

In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. 

The source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url). The article is a bit dated compared to the library code though.",Jot,False,2017-12-25T19:10:36.907+00:00,True,False,"A library for storing and reapplying application state (e.g. form sizes&locations, settings, user preferences etc).",".net,settings,state,persistence,wpf,winforms,asp.net,mvc",6399,False,1.2.1

The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand.

Andreas Beham,2015-08-21T19:29:03.537Z,"Sim# aims to port the concepts used in SimPy (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpy) to the .NET world. It is implemented in C# and builds on the .NET Framework 4.0. Sim# uses an efficient event queue (adapted from https://bitbucket.org/BlueRaja/high-speed-priority-queue-for-c) that allows to compute models very fast. Simulating 10 years of the MachineShop sample (http://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/machine_shop.html) that uses preemptive resources requires only 2.5s on a Core i7 2.6Ghz. This model generates more than 5 million events.

SimPy allows to model processes easily and with little boiler plate code. A process is described as a method that yields events. When an event is yielded, the process waits on it. Processes are themselves events and so it is convenient to spawn sub-processes that can either be waited upon or that run next to each other. There is no need to inherit from classes or understand a complex object oriented design.",SimSharp,False,2017-09-27T09:09:43.4+00:00,True,False,"A .NET port of SimPy, process-based discrete event simulation framework","discrete-event,simulation",1238,False,3.0.8
