 - Supports sending push notifications for many platforms:
  - Apple (APNS - iOS - iPhone, iPad)
  - Android (C2DM - Phone/Tablets)
  - Windows Phone 7 / 7.5 (and 8 presumably when it's released)
  - Blackberry (Not fully functional)
 - Fluent API for constructing Notifications for each platform
 - Auto Scaling of notification channels (more workers/connections are added as demand increases, and scaled down as it decreases)
 - Asynchronous code where possible, use of library is very event oriented
