Chris F Carroll,2013-12-27T11:05:41.73Z,"*TestBase* gets you off to a flying start when unit testing projects with dependencies.
It offers a rich extensible set of fluent assertions and a set of verifiable Fake Ado.Net components, with easy setup and verification.

TestBase.Shoulds
------------------
Chainable fluent assertions drill down to the point concisely.
UnitUnderTest.Action().ShouldNotBeNullOrEmpty().ShouldContain(x=>x.ExpectedField == expected);
* Lots of Shoulds: ShouldBe(),ShouldSatisfy(),ShouldHave(),ShouldBeTrue(),ShouldBeGreaterThan(),ShouldBeLessThan(),ShouldBeGreaterThanOrEqual(),ShouldBeAssignableTo(),ShouldBeBetween(),ShouldBeNullOrEmpty(),...
* Enumerable Assertions: ShouldBeEmpty(),ShouldContain(),ShouldContainEachItemOf(),ShouldBeIn(),ShouldHave(),ShouldAll(),...
* Lots of Nots: ShouldNotBe(),ShouldNotBeNullOrEmpty(),ShouldNotContain(),...
* String & Regex Assertions:ShouldContain(),ShouldEqualIgnoringCase(),ShouldMatch(),ShouldNotBeNullOrEmptyOrWhitespace(),...
* StreamAssertions:ShouldContain(stream),ShouldContain(byte[]),ShouldEqualByValue(stream)
* ShouldEqualByValue() compares all kinds of objects and collections field-by-field, by value, basis
new{f1=1,f2=""2""}ShouldEqualByValue(new{f1=1,f2=""2""});
new[]{1,2}.ShouldEqualByValue(new List<int>{1,2});

TestBase.FakeDb
------------------
Works with Ado.Net and technologies on top of it, including Dapper.
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForQuery(fakeData, new[] {""FieldName1"", FieldName2""})
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForExecuteNonQuery(rowsAffected)
* fakeDbConnection.Verify(x=>x.CommandText.Matches(""Insert MyTable"") && x.Parameters[""id""].Value==1)

TestBase.TestBase<T> AutoMocksAndFakes
--------------------------------
is in development and currently works non-recursively. It auto-constructs the UnitUnderTest.
It identifies constructor dependencies by name and type, looking in the following places:
1) Fields in the TestFixture class 
2) Entries in the Mocks[] or Fake[] dictionaries
3) Finally it creates a Mock (if it's a mockable type) or a default instance (if its sealed, or value type) for anything that's missing

See also: TestBase-Mvc for Asp.Net MVC assertions such as ControllerUnderTest.Action().ShouldBeViewResult().ShouldHaveModelOfType<T>().Field1.ShouldEqual(expected);
