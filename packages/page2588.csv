"Intuit,Inc.",2017-07-13T21:12:38.867Z,43209,281,"The IPP .NET SDK for QuickBooks V3 is a set of .NET classes that make it easier to call QuickBooks APIs.  Some of the features included in this SDK are as follows:

-Ability to perform single and batch processing of CRUD operations on all QuickBooks entities.

-Request and Response Handler has common interface with two implemented classes to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

-Support for both XML and JSON Request and Response format.

-Ability to configure app settings in the configuration file requiring no additional code change.

-Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of QuickBooks API calls.

-Retry policy constructors to help apps handle transient errors.

-Logging mechanisms for trace, request/response, and Azure logging.

-Sync APIs that assist with data synchronization between QuickBooks Desktop and Intuit's cloud.

-Query Filters that enable you to write LINQ queries to retrieve QuickBooks entities whose properties meet specified criteria.

-LINQ queries for accessing QuickBooks Reports.

-Sparse Update to update writable properties specified in a request and leave the others unchanged.

-Change data that enables you to retrieve a list of entities modified during specified time points.
