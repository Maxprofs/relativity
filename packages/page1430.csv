In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. 

The source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url).

It offers a rich extensible set of fluent assertions and a set of verifiable Fake Ado.Net components, with easy setup and verification.

TestBase.Shoulds
------------------

UnitUnderTest.Action()
  .ShouldNotBeNull()
  .ShouldContain(expected);
UnitUnderTest.OtherAction()
  .ShouldEqualByValue( 
    new {Id=1, Payload=expectedPayload, Additional=new[]{ expected1, expected2 }}

* ShouldEqualByValue() works with all kinds of object and collections
* Stream assertions include ShouldContain() and ShouldEqualByValue()

TestBase.FakeDb
------------------
Works with Ado.Net and technologies on top of it, including Dapper.
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForQuery(IEnumerable<TFakeData> )
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForQuery(IEnumerable<Tuple<TFakeDataForTable1,TFakeDataForTable2>> )

TestBase.TestBase<T> AutoMocksAndFakes
--------------------------------
is in development and currently works non-recursively. It auto-constructs the UnitUnderTest.
It identifies constructor dependencies by name and type, looking in the following places:
1) Fields in the TestFixture class 
2) Entries in the Mocks[] or Fake[] dictionaries
3) Finally it creates a Mock (if it's a mockable type) or a default instance (if its sealed, or value type) for anything that's missing

In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included.

Antonio Nakic Alfirevic,2016-03-10T10:20:27.59Z,116,771,"A library that makes it easier to persist and reapply application state (window locations and sizes, user settings and preferences, etc.). 

In its simplest use case you can use it as an alternative to a .settings file. Take for example a window. 
To make its size and location immune to shutdown, you would basically only write something like this:

stateTrackerInstance
    .Configure(theWindow).IdentifyAs(""theMainWindow"")
    .AddProperties<MainWindow>(w => w.Height, w => w.Width, w => w.Left, w => w.Top, w => w.WindowState)
    .RegisterPersistTrigger(""Closed"")
    .Apply();    

No need to define properties in the .settings file and then use them from two additional places (window startup and window close)

You can control almost everything about Jot: where the data is stored, how and if it is serialized, what data to take care of and when to persist and apply which piece of data.

It's not limited to tracking forms and windows, you can track any kind of object, e.g. settings objects, user preferences, last selections etc. 

And it's not just for desktop applications either, you can use it to make MVC controller properties stateful (it can use Session, UserProfile or some other custom store as the backing store for the data).

The library is tiny (well under 1000 LOC) it's highly customizable and provides many extension points, but comes with batteries included. 

The source repository is on github, and there is an article describing it on codeproject (check the project url). The article is a bit dated compared to the library code though.",Jot,False,2017-12-25T19:10:36.907+00:00,True,False,"A library for storing and reapplying application state (e.g. form sizes&locations, settings, user preferences etc).",".net,settings,state,persistence,wpf,winforms,asp.net,mvc",6505,False,1.2.5

Although this protocol is simple, applications are free to exchange strings between the client and server in any convenient or suitable format they choose. Exchanging strings of XML for example is an easy way to create an extensible general purpose contract between client and server.
