d-fens GmbH, General-Guisan-Strasse 6, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland

This PowerShell module contains Cmdlets that allow to perform logging from your PowerShell functions and code via the Apache Log4Net library.

* You can also download this module via [NuGet](http://nuget.org) with [Install-Package biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging/). 

* After downloading the package to a directory of your choice (_NOT_ the actual module directory) run the `install.ps1` script in the downloaded folder to copy the files to a directory inside `$ENV:PSModulePath`).

* In case you already have a previous version of this module ( < 1.0.5) in a different module directory you have to remove that module manually.

* In case you update the module in the same directory and the `log4net.dll` is still loaded you might have to restart all the PowerShell sessions to be able to overwrite the file.

* In case you changed the log settings in `biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging.xml`, `Log4netConfiguration.xml` or `log4net.xml` you have to restore the changes as they will get overwritten.

See http://d-fens.ch/2013/01/16/module-biz-dfch-ps-system-logging/ and the [Wiki](https://github.com/dfch/biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging/wiki) for more information.",biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging,False,2016-07-15T00:45:42.837-07:00,True,False,This PowerShell module provides Cmdlets to perform logging from your PowerShell script via log4net to arbitrary log format.

Instead of building, maintaining, revising, and defending your application's infrastructure; you can focus on what you do best-application development.

DevForce implements end-to-end n-tier architecture by exposing a generic web service on the server that takes a LINQ expression and returns business objects to the client over the internet.

Write LINQ queries on the client and get back business objects with your own custom business logic-just like working with a 2-tier or client-server application.
