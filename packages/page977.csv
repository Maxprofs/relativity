d-fens GmbH, General-Guisan-Strasse 6, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland

This PowerShell module contains Cmdlets that allow to perform logging from your PowerShell functions and code via the Apache Log4Net library.

* You can also download this module via [NuGet](http://nuget.org) with [Install-Package biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging/). 

* After downloading the package to a directory of your choice (_NOT_ the actual module directory) run the `install.ps1` script in the downloaded folder to copy the files to a directory inside `$ENV:PSModulePath`).

* In case you already have a previous version of this module ( < 1.0.5) in a different module directory you have to remove that module manually.

* In case you update the module in the same directory and the `log4net.dll` is still loaded you might have to restart all the PowerShell sessions to be able to overwrite the file.

* In case you changed the log settings in `biz.dfch.PS.System.Logging.xml`, `Log4netConfiguration.xml` or `log4net.xml` you have to restore the changes as they will get overwritten.
