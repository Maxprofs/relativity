Lenny Granovsky,2012-11-03T14:52:04.85Z,"The library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling strategies: 
 Linear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing specified delay between consequent requests;
 Short Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; it does not limit overall number of requests, but rather assures blocking excessive requests; this strategy is very helpful to cut the requests flooding caused by such user behaviors as multi-click or hard click on F5 button;
 Long Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; this strategy limits an overall number of calls within long time duration; this is also known as applying penalty to the client for excessive application use.

 Each throttling controller uniquely determines the client making requests. It does not purely rely on client IP address allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the IIS.
The Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.

The Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode whether it logs blocking information to IIS log, but allows request to continue. The log-only mode is very useful when there is a need to determine the most appropriate throttling configuration parameters.

The code is highly optimized having very low memory impact and taking less than 0.3 ms to run on a regular development laptop.

As an extra functionality it provides with real-time snapshot of current throttling status for all controllers. The snap-shot is available online as a JSON output.

Lenny Granovsky,2012-11-03T00:26:52.19Z,"The library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling strategies: 
 Linear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing specified delay between consequent requests;
 Short Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; it does not limit overall number of requests, but rather assures blocking excessive requests; this strategy is very helpful to cut the requests flooding caused by such user behaviors as multi-click or hard click on F5 button;
 Long Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; this strategy limits an overall number of calls within long time duration; this is also known as applying penalty to the client for excessive application use.

 Each throttling controller uniquely determines the client making requests. It does not purely rely on client IP address allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the IIS.
The Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.

The Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode whether it logs blocking information to IIS log, but allows request to continue. The log-only mode is very useful when there is a need to determine the most appropriate throttling configuration parameters.

The code is highly optimized having very low memory impact and taking less than 0.3 ms to run on a regular development laptop.

As an extra functionality it provides with real-time snapshot of current throttling status for all controllers. The snap-shot is available online as a JSON output.

 Linear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing specified delay between consequent requests;
 Short Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; it does not limit overall number of requests, but rather assures blocking excessive requests; this strategy is very helpful to cut the requests flooding caused by such user behaviors as multi-click or hard click on F5 button;
 Long Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; this strategy limits an overall number of calls within long time duration; this is also known as applying penalty to the client for excessive application use.

 Each throttling controller uniquely determines the client making requests. It does not purely rely on client IP address allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the IIS.
The Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.

The Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode whether it logs blocking information to IIS log, but allows request to continue. The log-only mode is very useful when there is a need to determine the most appropriate throttling configuration parameters.

The code is highly optimized having very low memory impact and taking less than 0.3 ms to run on a regular development laptop.

DevForce fills this gap so you don't have to. Instead of building, maintaining, revising, and defending your application's infrastructure; you can focus on what you do best-application development.

DevForce implements end-to-end n-tier architecture by exposing a generic web service on the server that takes a LINQ expression and returns business objects to the client over the internet.

Write LINQ queries on the client and get back business objects with your own custom business logic-just like working with a 2-tier or client-server application.
