Microsoft,2015-10-29T20:36:44.977Z,4,904,"Library for automatically synthesizing programs from examples.
    
Microsoft PROgram Synthesis using Examples SDK (PROSE) is a framework of technologies for automatic generation of programs from input-output examples, keywords, and similar forms of imprecise specification. In PROSE, you define a domain-specific language (DSL) of programs that constitute your domain of useful tasks (e.g. a DSL of CSS selectors). At runtime, you give PROSE some (typically user-provided) input-output examples for the desired program's behavior, and its algorithms synthesize a ranked set of programs from this DSL that are consistent with the given examples. These programs can be saved and applied on similar user data after one learning session (typically with 1-4 examples). PROSE can be used to enable programming-by-example experience in an arbitrary user-facing application, provided the app developer describes its application domain in a DSL form.

As part of the project, the PROSE framework includes a set of specific tecnologies for various data wrangling domains. These include FlashFill, a library of string transformations from Microsoft Excel 2013, text extraction library with a DSL of programs that find a desired sequence of regions in a textual file, and a web extraction library with a CSS-based DSL of programs that select a set of elements on a web page. All three data wrangling libraries, as well as the underlying program synthesis framework, can currently be used out of the box for research, education, and other non-commercial initiatives.",Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis,True,2018-04-16T18:16:55.963+00:00,True,False,Library for automatically synthesizing programs from examples.,"Program,Synthesis,SDK,Examples",6042,True,0.1.1-preview

MoonStorm,2015-10-29T23:42:39.257Z,1,904,"The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Count()
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.

MoonStorm,2015-10-30T04:55:23.447Z,1,903,"The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Count()
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.

Dippel,2015-10-30T00:44:00.297Z,643,903,"Enums and Delegates are a fundimental component of .Net, however, as of version 6.0 of the C# language, there's no way to (directly) constrain a generic parameter to System.Enum or System.Delegate.

This package addresses that need.  Written in C++/CLI since C# cannot declare an enum or delegate restriction, this library provides a set of well performing extension and static methods off of the ""Diagonactic.Enums"" class that provide a more readable way of performing common operations on enums and delegates, all of which can be consumed by C# code.

Microsoft PROgram Synthesis using Examples SDK (PROSE) is a framework of technologies for automatic generation of programs from input-output examples, keywords, and similar forms of imprecise specification. In PROSE, you define a domain-specific language (DSL) of programs that constitute your domain of useful tasks (e.g. a DSL of CSS selectors). At runtime, you give PROSE some (typically user-provided) input-output examples for the desired program's behavior, and its algorithms synthesize a ranked set of programs from this DSL that are consistent with the given examples. These programs can be saved and applied on similar user data after one learning session (typically with 1-4 examples). PROSE can be used to enable programming-by-example experience in an arbitrary user-facing application, provided the app developer describes its application domain in a DSL form.

As part of the project, the PROSE framework includes a set of specific tecnologies for various data wrangling domains. These include FlashFill, a library of string transformations from Microsoft Excel 2013, text extraction library with a DSL of programs that find a desired sequence of regions in a textual file, and a web extraction library with a CSS-based DSL of programs that select a set of elements on a web page.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Count()
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});
