It enables developers to rapidly and cost-effectively transition existing Windows desktop applications to a service or API-based model. Whether you are an independent software vendor transitioning to SaaS or corporate IT unifying your development efforts, implementing with an API-based model gives existing applications the ability to seamlessly integrate even if built with different programming languages.

With Evolution, developers can create an API to expose the business rules developed in one language, such as DataFlex or C#, and have it available to be consumed by other languages via multiple protocols. The Evolution framework allows Windows developers to:
- Build an API using many development languages (C#, Java, DataFlex, VB, etc)

- Deliver mobile, Web, or desktop application solutions
