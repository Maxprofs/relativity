- Workflow version control. Keep track of your workflow changes and easily revert them.
- Parallel workflow support. Split workflows into branches that execute tasks concurrently.
- XML import/export. Export your workflows for further reuse and sharing.
- Localization support. Translate user interface to multiple languages of your choice.
- In-built workflow timers. Set intervals or specify time to run custom actions and workflow tasks.
