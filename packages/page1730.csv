We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most applications.
    The latest official release of FFTW is version 3.3.4, available from our download page. Version 3.3 introduced support for the AVX x86 extensions, a distributed-memory implementation on top of MPI, and a Fortran 2003 API. Version 3.3.1 introduced support for the ARM Neon extensions. See the release notes for more information.
    
    The FFTW package was developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson.
    
    Our benchmarks, performed on on a variety of platforms, show that FFTW's performance is typically superior to that of other publicly available FFT software, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned codes. In contrast to vendor-tuned codes, however, FFTW's performance is portable: the same program will perform well on most architectures without modification. Hence the name, ``FFTW, '' which stands for the somewhat whimsical title of ``Fastest Fourier Transform in the West.''","FFTW,nativepackage",554,False,3.3.4
