A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching existing Mechanisms and Gears you have already in your library.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.

Clockwork is a complete programming paradigm that lets you model and execute complex business processes. In Clockwork you write Gears that encapsulate specific business steps. Then you write code to assemble Gears together to compose complete business processes called Mechanisms. A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching existing Mechanisms and Gears you have already in your library.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.

Particularity is done on the HAL+JSON response. 
Installation:
On the package console run :
Install-Package HALJSonDeserializer
Usage:
After installation you must include the namespace of the package where you will use it:
using haljson;
So now: suppose that you want to call a web api via ""http://localhost:8080/customer"" in your c# code and to parse it into your custom type called ""Customer"". This can be done simply as follows:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParse<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
For async call you can do this:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParseAsync<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
If you just want to deserialize a Stream, a StreamReader or a string, their are three extrension methods for those type. You can do that as follows:
Customer  theCustomer = myStream.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a Stream
Customer  theCustomer = myStreamReader.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a StreamReader
Customer  theCustomer = myString.ToObject<Customer>(); //For a string",HALJSonDeserializer,False,2016-03-18T10:39:05.44+00:00,True,False,Parckage for deserializing HAL+JSon response datas,,2942,False,1.1.5.2
