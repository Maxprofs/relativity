Matt Campbell,2015-09-18T19:50:46.517Z,"While there are already countless math libraries for performing common matrix/array functions, StarMath is distinguished by its simplicity and flexbility. There is no need to declare vectors and matrices in a specific library format. It works simliar to Math.function calls in C#. 
The library is small and fully compiles to a Portable Class Library (for all platforms). StarMath (version > 2.0) takes advantage of  'extensions', which allows for concise representations of many functions. Now you can write either:
 StarMath.multiply(A, x);
 or
 A.multiply(x);

With astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.

With astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.
We have built the SSO Toolkit on top of IAM Cloud’s powerful identity engine, allowing applications to accept users from an enormous range of different sources and repositories, including Active Directory, WorkDay, PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle and many more.

The features provide the ability to decode and encode images, apply effects, blend, crop, rotate, and resize both on CPU and GPU. It also allows the developers to extend the functionality for custom scenarios. The SDK is highly optimized to be super-fast by meticulous memory and code optimization. The patented JPEG technology, RAJPEG, contributes to making this possible, as it allows access to any image data without decoding the whole image. That means you can apply effects to high resolution images, without worrying about your memory budget.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Count()
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.

With astonishingly little effort, organizations now can integrate Single Sign-On into their existing range of applications. Our Toolkit can be used for both desktop and web based applications. The Toolkit has powerful yet simple user-friendly interface, meaning programmers can make the most of our technology without being an identity expert.
We have built the SSO Toolkit on top of IAM Cloud’s powerful identity engine, allowing applications to accept users from an enormous range of different sources and repositories, including Active Directory, WorkDay, PeopleSoft, SQL, Oracle and many more.

MoonStorm,2015-08-07T06:42:39.66Z,"The fastest micro-orm type extension for Dapper.

For Dapper constructs in general, it is recommended to use Visual Studio 2015 for features such as nameof and string interpolation, but that's not a requirement.

The package contains .NET 4.5 and 4.6 DLLs, one of which will be installed based on the target framework in your project. 
For .NET 4.5, the package will also install the dependency 'StringInterpolationBridge', which contains the polyfills required when using string interpolation with the C# 6 compiler in VS 2015.

Features:
----------
- Support for LocalDb, Ms Sql Server, MySql, SqLite, PostgreSql
- Entities having composite primary keys are supported
- Multiple entity mappings are supported, useful for partial queries in large denormalized tables and data migrations between different database types.
- All the CRUD methods accept a transaction, a command timeout, and a custom entity mapping.
- Fast pre-computed entity queries
- A simple Sql builder with alias support is provided, which is very useful when manual SQL queries are unavoidable.
- A generic T4 template is also provided for convenience in the NuGet package Dapper.FastCrud.ModelGenerator.
Code first entities are also supported which can either be decorated with attributes such as Table, Key and DatabaseGenerated, or can have their mappings programmatically set.

Examples of usage:
-------------------
- using Dapper.FastCrud
- dbConnection.Insert(newEntity);
- dbConnection.Get()
- dbConnection.Get(new Entity() {Id = 10});
- dbConnection.Update(updatedEntity);
- dbConnection.Delete(entity)
- dbConnection.Count()
- dbConnection.Find<Entity>(
      whereClause:$""{nameof(Entity.FirstName)}=@FirstNameParam"",
      orderClause:$""{nameof(Entity.LastName)} DESC"",
      skipRowsCount:10, limitRowsCount:20,
      queryParameters: new {FirstNameParam: ""John""});

This is where the power of the C# 6 compiler comes into play, and leaves no chance to mistypings or to problems arising from db entity refactorings.

The patented JPEG technology, RAJPEG, contributes to making this possible, as it allows access to any image data without decoding the whole image. That means you can apply effects to high resolution images, without worrying about your memory budget.
