Radiator is a small framework that provides functionlity to execute and validate commands. The point of the framework is to work in conjuction with the CQRS (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) methodology. This framework does not provide Event Sourcing or Querying. This framework is purely for command execution and validation. This framework was first built to be used with MVC web projects, however it could be used in any kind of project and there is no reference or dependance on MVC.


How to use it?

Radiator is a small framework that provides functionlity to execute and validate commands. The point of the framework is to work in conjuction with the CQRS (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) methodology. This framework does not provide Event Sourcing or Querying. This framework is purely for command execution and validation. This framework was first built to be used with MVC web projects, however it could be used in any kind of project and there is no reference or dependance on MVC.


How to use it?
