      choose whatever unit test framework you like to run your tests and verify your test results.

      The TestEngine contains two base classes for your tests: WriteScenario<T> and ReadScenario<T>.
      The WriteScenario<T> can be extended to implement unit tests that execute against your business logic

      Both classes use the Given()/When()/Then() style to initialize, execute and verify your tests and its results.

      The beauty of these scenario classes is that they can re-use and be built on top of each other to create ever
      more sophisticated tests without much effort or extra code. In other words, composite scenarios can execute
      child scenarios inside their Given() phase to initialize their own begin-state. This way, composite scenarios
      build upon previously verified logic and resulting program states, which ensures your tests never run in a
