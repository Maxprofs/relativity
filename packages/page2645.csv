Iron Software Ocr and Imaging Development Team,2017-08-02T10:09:10.3Z,11,261,"IronOCR is an advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) & Barcode library for C# and VB.Net

The engine adds OCR functionality to Desktop, Console and Web applications in minutes. IronOCR reads all major Barcode and QR codes standards.

What makes IronOCR different is how well it deals with poor quality scans. IronOCR can read scans with low resolution, paper distortion and background noise.  It takes the time to analyze the input file and prepare it for OCR to achieve consistent results every time.

Image pre-processing supports: Rotation & De-Skewing, Background Noise Cleaning, Resolution Enhancement, Increasing Contrast, Colour Simplification, and Setting Crop Regions.

IronOCR automatically detects the quality of an image before reading. Developers can adjust advanced image processing settings if needed.

Data output options include: Plain Text, Barcode Data, Object model data (headings, paragraphs, lines, words  characters for each page).

Library Supports: Console Applications, ASP.NET Web Applications, MVC, Web APIs, and Desktop Applications written in any .Net language such as C# or VB.Net.

Requires: .Net framework 4.0 or above on the Windows Platform including Cloud hosting such as Azure.  Supports multithreading to improve OCR performance on multi-core servers.

Licensing & Support available for commercial deployments. For code examples, documentation & more visit http://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/ For support please email us at developers@ironsoftware.com",IronOcr,False,2018-04-09T02:35:34.577+00:00,True,False,The OCR Library for C# & VB.Net.
