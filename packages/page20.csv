There are 3 layers of security to prevent abuse. 

1. The API signs the remote url with HMAC SHA-256 to prevent anyone from tampering or generating them without access to the signing key.
2. A whitelist approach is taken to sites. By default, no sites are allowed. You must handle the RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.AllowRemoteRequest event to permit sites (or portions of sites) to be relayed.
4. The  plugin requires that all remote images be decoded and re-encoded. Files are never returned as-is. This ensures that the files are valid images, and prevents XSS attacks.

Please note, you must configure the <remotereader signingKey=""to a long and secure pass phrase"" /> and set <remotereader allowAllSignedRequests=""true"" /> if all code calling RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.CreateSignedUrl(remoteUrl,settings) is trusted.
