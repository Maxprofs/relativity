      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.
      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the CQL Binary Protocols v1, v2, and v3 and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v3 features: more queries per connection, timestamp property, UDT and Tuple types, larger collections
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Extremely fast, highly flexible and extendable type (conversion) system. Automatically converts parameters and results to the requested types.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
      * Extensive logging, including support for custom logger implementations

    Platform.VirtualFileSystem is a powerful .NET library that provides a uniform and cross-platform abstraction layer for file systems. It is similar to VFS features of various operating systems like Linux except it all runs in managed code.
    You can use one common API for accessing files from various sources (local, http, zip etc) as well as create user-defined file systems using views and overlays.
