There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).

It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).

Chris F Carroll,2013-12-23T17:14:34.63Z,12,1579,"*TestBase* gets you off to a flying start when unit testing projects with dependencies.
It offers a rich extensible set of fluent assertions and a set of verifiable Fake Ado.Net components, with easy setup and verification.

TestBase.Shoulds
------------------
Chainable fluent assertions get you to the point concisely
UnitUnderTest.Action()
  .ShouldNotBeNull()
  .ShouldContain(expected);
UnitUnderTest.OtherAction()
  .ShouldEqualByValue( 
    new {Id=1, Payload=expectedPayload, Additional=new[]{ expected1, expected2 }}
);
* ShouldBe(), ShouldMatch(), ShouldNotBe(), ShouldContain(), ShouldNotContain(), ShouldBeEmpty(), ShouldNotBeEmpty(), ShouldAll() and many more
* ShouldEqualByValue() works with all kinds of object and collections
* Stream assertions include ShouldContain() and ShouldEqualByValue()

TestBase.FakeDb
------------------
Works with Ado.Net and technologies on top of it, including Dapper.
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForQuery(fakeData, new[] {""FieldName1"", FieldName2""})
* fakeDbConnection.SetupForExecuteNonQuery(rowsAffected)
* fakeDbConnection.Verify(x=>x.CommandText.Matches(""Insert [case] .*"") && x.Parameters[""id""].Value==1)

TestBase.TestBase<T> AutoMocksAndFakes
--------------------------------
is in development and currently works non-recursively. It auto-constructs the UnitUnderTest.
It identifies constructor dependencies by name and type, looking in the following places:
1) Fields in the TestFixture class 
2) Entries in the Mocks[] or Fake[] dictionaries
3) Finally it creates a Mock (if it's a mockable type) or a default instance (if its sealed, or value type) for anything that's missing
