Aspose,2018-02-10T05:37:04.82Z,22,69,"Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a cross-platform class library that enables your applications to perform a great range of document processing tasks. Aspose.Tasks supports MPP, MPT, XML, XLSX, HTML, PDF, XAML and other formats. With Aspose.Tasks you can generate, modify, convert, render and print documents without utilizing Microsoft Project®.

Aspose.Tasks for .NET is well documented to help you create your solutions on different platforms.

Rich Set of Features

Aspose.Tasks for .NET features can be divided into four main areas:
 - Conversions: High quality conversions to and from MPP, MPT, XML, XLSX, HTML, PDF, Oracle Primavera, OpenProj and formats
 - Document Object Model: Programmatic access through a rich API to all document elements allows to create, modify, extract, copy and replace the most of document content
 - Rendering: Convert whole documents or pages to PDF, XPS or for server-side document generation. Also convert document pages to TIFF, PNG, BMP of JPEG images, print or render pages to .NET Graphics. All with high fidelity - exactly like Microsoft Project® would have done it.

Platform Independence

You can use Aspose.Tasks for .NET to build any type of a 32-bit or 64-bit .NET application including ASP.NET, WCF, WinForms, WPF etc. It is possible to use Aspose.Tasks for .NET via COM Interop from ASP, Perl, PHP and Python. You can also use Aspose.Tasks for .NET to build applications with Mono.

Performance and Scalability

Aspose.Tasks is designed to perform great both on a server or client. Aspose.Tasks is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about any other services or modules. You can literally generate thousands of documents in minutes with Aspose.Tasks and that involves opening a document, modifying content and formatting or populating it with data and saving it. Even most of the complex documents are opened and saved on a P4 2.4Ghz 1Gb RAM machine in fractions of a second.

Aspose.Tasks is multithread safe as long as only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.
