Amit Patankar,2014-10-03T18:51:17.587Z,"A tiny C# class to handle arguments sent to a console application.

Tiny uses the power of Dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to 
dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.

Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, 
for example if the command line for your app is:

c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3

Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.

The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:

static void Main(string[] args) { Tiny t = new Tiny(args); }

You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:

t.Arguments.testargument1 t.Arguments.testargument2

Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.

Features:
- Custom user-defined data types
    C# native data types have been implemented
        Boolean/bool
        Byte/byte, Char/char, SByte/sbyte

        String/string (supports C# escape sequences including unicode \xX(XXX) \uXXXX and \UXXXXXXXX)
        Single/float, Double/double
        DateTime is not implemented as it does not have a literal format in C#. But it can be implemented by the user.
- Variables, static and dynamic.
- Custom user-defined operators
    Default C# binary operators have been implemented for all native data types

Amit Patankar,2014-10-20T17:10:02.34Z,"A tiny C# class to handle arguments sent to a console application.

Tiny uses the power of Dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to 
dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.

Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, 
for example if the command line for your app is:

c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3

Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.

The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:

static void Main(string[] args) { Tiny t = new Tiny(args); }

You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:

t.Arguments.testargument1 t.Arguments.testargument2

Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.

In the above example, the last argument can be read via:

t.Arguments.UndefinedArgument1

You can now also use methods like count and contains.

Example:

t.Arguments.count

if(t.Arguments.contains(""arg1"")){

Kevin Dockx (Marvin),2014-11-05T01:25:35.997Z,"JSON Patch (RFC 6902) support for .NET to easily allow and apply partial REST-ful service (through Web API) updates from any client (portable class library)

JSON Patch (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) defines a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document; it is suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method. The ""application/json-patch+json"" media type is used to identify such patch documents.

One of the things this can be used for is partial updates for REST-ful API's, or, to quote the IETF: ""This format is also potentially useful in other cases in which it is necessary to make partial updates to a JSON document or to a data structure that has similar constraints (i.e., they can be serialized as an object or an array using the JSON grammar).""

That's what this package is all about.
