- Embedded .NET family assembly, platform independent and without references to other libraries. 
- Multi-threaded, ACID compliant, with a solution for deadlocks resolving/elimination, parallel reads and synchronized writes/reads. 
- No fixed scheme for table names (construction and access on the fly).
- Tables can reside in mixed locations: different folders, hard drives, memory.
- Liana-Trie indexing technology. Database indexes (keys) never need to be defragmented. Speed of insert/update/remove operations doesn't change during the time.
- Ability to access Key/Value pair of a table by physical link, what can economize time for joining necessary data structures.
- No limits for database size (except ""long"" size for each table and physical resources constraints).
- Low memory and physical space consumption, also while random inserts and updates. Updates reside the same physical space, if possible.
- High performance of CRUD operations. When you need, unleash DBreeze power and get 500000 key/value pairs insert or 260K updates per second per core into sorted table on the hard drive of standard PC.
- High speed of random keys batch insert and updates (batch must be sorted in memory ascending and non-overwrite flag must be set).
- Range selects / Traversing (Forward, Backward, From/To, Skip, StartsWith etc). Remove keys, change keys.
- Keys and values, on the low level, are always byte arrays. 
- Max. key size is 65KB, max. value size is 2GB. Value can be represented as a set of columns, where can be stored data types of fixed or dynamic length. Every dynamic datablock can be of size 2GB. 
- Rich set of conversion functions from/to between byte[] and other data types.
- Nested / Fractal tables which can reside inside of master tables values.
- Incremental backup/restore option.
- Integrated text-search subsystem (full-text/partial).
- Integrated object database layer.
- Fast multi-parameter search subsystem with powerful query possibilities.
- DBreeze is a foundation for complex data storage solutions (graph/neuro, object, document, text search etc. data layers). Please, study documentation to understand all abilities of DBreeze.

Wim van Gool,2018-02-09T08:34:51.26Z,30,70,"The Kingo TestEngine library contains a few simple components that allow you to create unit tests
      and integration tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style on top of applications that
      were implemented using the MicroProcessor design from the Kingo library. You are, of source, free to
      choose whatever unit test framework you like to run your tests and verify your test results.

      The TestEngine contains two base classes for your tests: WriteScenario<T> and ReadScenario<T>.
      The WriteScenario<T> can be extended to implement unit tests that execute against your business logic
      (message handlers), whereas the ReadScenario<T> can be extended to execute and test your queries.
      Both classes use the Given()/When()/Then() style to initialize, execute and verify your tests and its results.

      The beauty of these scenario classes is that they can re-use and be built on top of each other to create ever
      more sophisticated tests without much effort or extra code. In other words, composite scenarios can execute
      child scenarios inside their Given() phase to initialize their own begin-state. This way, composite scenarios
      build upon previously verified logic and resulting program states, which ensures your tests never run in a
      corrupt or unreachable program state.

      The Kingo TestEngine also opens the door to easily generate documentation from your unit tests and integration tests.
