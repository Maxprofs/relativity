Besides the common features a HTML to PDF Converter must have, the HiQPdf component has some unique features on the market like the support for web fonts in Web Open Font Format (WOFF), the ability to convert only a selected region of the HTML document or the possibility to overlap multiple HTML documents in the same PDF while preserving the transparent backgrounds and images from the HTML document.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents with last generation content like Scalar Vector Graphics, Canvas and CSS3 styles. The JavaScript engine is fast, can handle complex scripts and exposes in HTML page objects you can use to manually trigger conversion or to determine various information about converter during conversion.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents using Web Fonts in formats like Web Open Font Format (WOFF), TrueType or OpenType with TrueType Outlines. The Web Fonts offer a great flexibility to web designers to create special effects on text in a HTML document because they are not limited anymore to a small set of fonts installed on the client computers displaying the HTML document.",hiqpdf,False,2017-08-19T11:55:58.87+00:00,True,False,"The HiQPdf Library for .NET offers you a modern, simple, fast, flexible and powerful tool to create complex and stylish PDF documents in your applications with just a few lines of code.","HTML,to,PDF,Converter",106328,False,7.2.0

For Developers

The Web Blocks system has been developed to encapsulate code for each block in a re-usable and loosely coupled way. Blocks can now makes use of Partial Views, neatly organising your scripts into re-usable and shareable snippets. Templates can be developed to be pre-populated with blocks and also blocks can be added retrospectively to templates populating all pages using this template with the new block that has been added. For interface developers the Web Blocks system is very flexible and can adapted to work with any interface framework.

The Web Blocks system provides the ability to drag blocks of content into defined areas on a preview canvas, directly from the content tree. Users can create blocks in the content tree in the same way as creating normal pages i.e. from pre-defined block/content types.  Content editors can also update their content live from the front end of the web site.  Blocks behave just like any other node in the content tree and can have parameters just like normal content pages. Once created blocks can be dragged into the preview panel and re-ordered by dragging around the canvas. Once on the canvas, a block can be double-clicked to pop-up an overlay showing the parameters of that block including WYSISYG editor, media pickers etc.",MentorWebBlocks,False,2017-04-19T07:44:55.93-07:00,True,False,"Mentor Web Blocks adds drag and drop website building functionality for content editors, and excellent code encapsulation for developers.","Mentor,Web,Blocks,Drag,and,Drop,Umbraco",3105,False,3.1.0
