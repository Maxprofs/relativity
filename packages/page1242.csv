            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.

Dippel,2015-12-15T00:27:07.2Z,643,857,"Enums and Delegates are a fundimental component of .Net, however, as of version 6.0 of the C# language, there's no way to (directly) constrain a generic parameter to System.Enum or System.Delegate. There's so many reasons to want to do so, not the least of which is the set of kludgy static methods on Enum and Delegate that would really benefit from generic implementations.

This package addresses that need.  Written in C++/CLI since C# cannot declare an enum or delegate restriction, this library provides a set of well performing extension and static methods off of the ""Diagonactic.Enums"" class that provide a more readable way of performing common operations on enums and delegates, all of which can be consumed by C# code.

Enum methods are stable, Delegate methods are considered ""Beta"".  As a result, the API for Delegate methods may be modified (Obsolete tags for invalid members will be added if this happens), though every effort will be made to avoid this.  Enum methods are API stable, however, methods are added occasionally.

All stable methods are unit tested for all underlying types with complete code coverage.
