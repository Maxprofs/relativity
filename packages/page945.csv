            * Poor tuple support
            * Null reference problem
            * Lack of lambda and expression inference

        Features:

            Powerful 'prelude' which you include by `using static LanguageExt.Prelude` (in C# 6) that covers many of the basic functional language core library functions and types (from `using LanguageExt`):

                Pattern matching
                Lambda type-inference: `var fn = fun( (int x, int y) => x + y );`
                `Option<T>`, `OptionUnsafe<T>`, `Either<L,R>`, `EitherUnsafe<L,R>` and `TryOption<T>` monads (probably the most complete implementations you'll find in the .NET world)
                `tuple(a,b,...)` - `Tuple` construction without typing `Tuple.Create(a,b,...)` as well as `map` to project the `Item1..ItemN` properties onto named values.
                `List` - immutable list 
                `Map` - immutable map                                                
                `Set` - immutable set
