•	High refresh rate even with heavy load
•	Renders vast data sets instantly
•	Series types: sampled data (discrete signal), point-line, freeform point-line, areas, high-low, polygon, stock series (candle-stick), bar, band, constant line, intensity grid, intensity mesh
•	Geographic maps can be combined with other XY view series and objects.
•	Intensity series are perfect e.g. for environmental data over maps and thermal imaging. Can be rendered inside selected polygons or map regions.
•	Zoom, pan and rotate operations
•	Built-in series tracking cursors
•	Series and chart event marker indicators
•	Unlimited X axes/chart, vertical position adjust
•	Unlimited Y axes/chart: stacked or layered

•	Automatic scale fitting, grids and divisions
•	Fast scale setting with mouse, configurable zoom and pan buttons
•	Logarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1
•	Palette-colored line series by Y value
•	Persistent layers - extremely fast rendering of thousands of repetitive line series without rising CPU load or memory footprint
•	Persistent intensity layers - heat-map coloring of repetitive traces with hit-counters

3D XYZ View
•	Real 3D visualization
•	Series types: point-line, bar, surface mesh, surface grid, waterfall, mesh models
•	Gigantic surface sizes of over 2000x2000
•	Height/Toned/Point/Bitmap coloring for surfaces
•	3D rectangles with image fill
•	Contour lines and wireframing for surfaces and waterfall

•	Zoom, pan and rotate operations, axis range adjust by mouse
•	Logarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1

Geographic maps and G.I.S.
•	Vector maps
•	On-line tile maps: supports street maps and satellite imagery by MapQuest/OpenStreetMaps
•	World, continents, specific areas
•	Dozens of maps
•	Multi-layer: land, lakes, rivers, roads, cities etc.
•	High/Mid/Low resolutions
•	Map import from ESRI shape file data
•	On-the-fly silent map layer replace/import for frequently updated SHP data
•	Polygon and vector based objects

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).
