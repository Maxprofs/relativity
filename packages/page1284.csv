Mvx Plugins Settings provides a consistent, cross platform settings plugin for Windows Phone, Windows Store, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android when using MvvmCross.  This makes it easier to create cross-platform .NET apps and have cross platform settings. Manage and use all settings from one PCL and save natively on each platform. *This plugin stores settings natively on each platform and does NOT save them to Json. This allows you to use native functionality such as PreferenceActivity on Android.

         Support for: Int, Int64, Double, String, DateTime, Bool, Float, Decimal, Guid

         You can always serialize and deserialize a string out if needed.
         
         I recommend using:  https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Settings as this will be updated more frequently.
