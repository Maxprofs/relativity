The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI.

It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a rich declaration and type information model.

In this way SqlTableDependency class provides access to notifications without knowing anything about the underlying Service Broker infrastructure. Once a record changed happens, SqlTableDependency's event subscribers are notified.

Example:
Monitor record table changes with WPF and WCF at https://stockprices.codeplex.com
Monitor table change with MVC, SignalR and Knockout at https://realtimenotifications.codeplex.com
Monitor table change with MVC, SignalR and jQuery at https://recordtablechanges.codeplex.com
