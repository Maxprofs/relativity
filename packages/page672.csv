Traditionally, TARGIT Analysis Suite has provided several standard data visualizations, such as the ones mentioned above. After selecting measures and dimensions for a data object, switching between such standard data visualizations has always been quick and easy.

Should you wish to view your data as, say, a pie chart that looks like an actual real-world pie or as a bunch of green pulsating dots on an animated radar screen, you would not have been unable to do. Until now.

Creating and using custom data visualizations is made available for C# developers through our TARGIT Data Visualizations NuGet package, free of charge.
