â¾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
â¾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
â¾Natively works asynchronously â great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
â¾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.

If you are a library or framework author and you wish to provide logging support in your component there are a  number of options: 1) Depend on a specific logging framework 2) Depend on Common.Logging 3) Implement your own ILog interface and make your consumers wire it up.

Option 1 is not desirable because it forces your users to use a particular framework. Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuget package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns in addition to wiring up. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.

â¾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
â¾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
â¾Natively works asynchronously â great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
â¾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
â¾Has a data access performance curve so good itâs just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection â the cost of using it is negligible.
