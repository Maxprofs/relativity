â¾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
â¾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
â¾Natively works asynchronously â great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
â¾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
â¾Has a data access performance curve so good itâs just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection â the cost of using it is negligible.

Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuget package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns in addition to wiring up. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.

This library contains methods for:

* Time change check (make sure the time has not been changed on the client computer)
* Key Validation (this will use http://serialkeymanager.com/ to validate keys against the database)
* Key Activation (this will, depending on the settings, activate a key with a specific machine code)
* Get Machine Code (calculates a machine code given any hash function)
* Get Eight Digit Hash (returns an 8 digit long hash number)

Note
* The article of how the activation component can be used is found here: http://support.serialkeymanager.com/howto/key-activation-through-a-client-application/

So, what to do about it? We made one ourselves â the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
â¾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere youâd use an ObsevableCollection<T> â no need to change any of your existing controls.
â¾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
â¾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
â¾Natively works asynchronously â great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
â¾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
â¾Has a data access performance curve so good itâs just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection â the cost of using it is negligible.
â¾Works in any .NET project because itâs implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",VirtualizingObservableCollection,False,2015-03-31T11:43:02.803-07:00,True,False,PCL Implementation of a VirtualizingObservableCollection that implements full editing and is highly performing.,"mvvm,wpf,windowsstore,win8,windowsphone,windowsphone8,xamarin,xaramin.forms,virtualization",8040,False,0.8.3

If you are a library or framework author and you wish to provide logging support in your component there are a  number of options: 1) Depend on a specific logging framework 2) Depend on Common.Logging 3) Implement your own ILog interface and make your consumers wire it up.

Option 1 is not desirable because it forces your users to use a particular framework. Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuget package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns in addition to wiring up. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.

This package is a variation of option 3 but will automatically wire things up too.
- It will add an ILog, ILogProvider etc to YourRootNamespace.Logging
- ILog is 2 methods to implement in comparison to Common.Logging ILog's ~65 members
