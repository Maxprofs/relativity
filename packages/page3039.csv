Richard J. Cabral,2017-12-05T21:07:02.713Z,67,136,"Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
The Feature.Navigation library solves the frequently occurring problem that the primary navigation or footer navigation of a website does not necessarily
share organization with the contents of the content tree. The reason may be differing SEO goals on URL construction, the need to name something differently
in navigation as opposed to the Page's heading values, or the need to construct a cross-cutting menu that draws Items from a wide variety of locations. This
library also gracefully handles the need to have external or document links within a static navigation system (such as a ""fat footer"").
		
Components:
- Navigation Menu - This is a marker item that specifies the root of a static navigation definition for a given website. There can be many of these on any particular
website. It is recommended that these Items become the Datasource of your Navigation renderings.

- Navigation Link - This is the conceptual member of a navigation and represent a hyperlink, visible to the user, that actually navigates somewhere else (as opposed to
click-to-open style links or buttons) Includes the link as a General Link with all its available options, as well as a flag to indicate the link text should come
from the Navigation Link Item's Display Name, which is the recommended approach to ensure the Navigation definition in Sitecore looks like what you see on page. Can be nested.
- Image Navigation Link - Because there's always some navigation that is represented via icons rather than text. Inherits from above.

- Link Group - Allows for the grouping of Navigation links into named groups. Very useful for pull-down navigation menu options, or Fat Footers with named columns.
Can be nested.

- NavigationRepository - Static class that accepts a Navigation Menu item and assembles a full tree-like ViewModel for immediate processing in your View.



You must install the included package to get the Templates required to use the rules in this library.

Richard J. Cabral,2017-12-05T21:01:53.623Z,59,136,"Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.
		
The Foundation.ModelMapping library is inspired by AutoMapper and is designed to provide a quick, non-ORM method of
mapping Sitecore Items to ViewModels. String properties on your ViewModel will be mapped to FieldRendered values from fields with the 
same names. Integer, DateTime, and Uri property types can also be handled automatically, although you will not get page editor support
for these types. There are a number of Attributes that you can assign to your ViewModel's properties to change the behavior of the Mapper.

Usage: TModel viewModel = ModelMapper.MapItemToNew<TModel>(sourceItem);

Constraints:
- Your ViewModel must have a public, parameterless constructor.
- Only Writable, Public Instance properties will be mapped.
- Within Sitecore, your field names can be human-legible. ModelMapper will attempt to convert the field name to a valid Property name. Simpler names work best. 
You can use the Field's Display Name for better human legibility and keep the Field's actual name closer to a legit C# entity name.

The following Model properties are mapped to Item properties rather than Item fields:
- ID - Maps to the Item.ID - Make sure you use Sitecore.Data.ID as the property type.
- Name - Maps to the Item.Name 
- DisplayName - Maps to Item.DisplayName
- Url - can be a string or a Uri type. Causes the current context LinkManager to generate a Url for the Item.

Support for XML Field Attributes
- ImageField.Alt - use Model.FieldNameAlt
- ImageField.Height - use Model.FieldNameHeight
- GeneralLink.Target - use Model.FieldNameTarget
- etc.

Support for LinkField.TargetItem - use Model.FieldNameTargetItem and supply a class with public properties and a parameterless constructor.
Support for MultilistField.GetItems - use Model.FieldName and supply a generic ICollection of type ""T"" where ""T"" is new() and has properties you can map.

Extensible! See the Constellation.Foundation.ModelMapping.config file to change the way Fields are processed.

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
