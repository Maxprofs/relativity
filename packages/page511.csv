Lenny Granovsky,2014-05-31T16:17:30.023Z,43209,1420,"This project is a spin-off of the original ""Throttling Suite for ASP.NET Applications"" with improved capabilities providing implementation for .NET Web API framework. The implementation supports all available hosting options provisioning equal functionality for IIS-hosted and OWIN self-hosted solutions. It is specifically designed to throttle high performance and high throughput Web API applications.

The library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling algorithms:
Linear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing consistent delay between consequent requests;
Short Average - limits the number of calls by ensuring consistent average over period of time, but allowing to have smaller traffic bursts for short time intervals; this type of throttling is very helpful cutting HTTP request floods;
Long Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration as short-average does, but includes ""blocked"" calls into total count, penalizing client for excessive application use.

Each throttling controller is capable of unique client determination and management. The throttling for any end-point, or set of end-points can be configured either for the entire application, or per-client. It does not purely rely on client IP address, allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the server. 
The Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.

The Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode.

The code is highly optimized having very low memory impact. The throttling evaluation functionality takes less than 0.3 ms to run.

The v1.2 is updated to include ""Retry-After"" response header in the blocked response helping API client to negotiate the request rate with API server side. 

The v1.2 also allows to ignore the actual request URL substituting one with Throttling controller instance scope. This provides the benefit to count requests for multiple API endpoints toward the same throttling threshold.

The v1.3 enables configuration from the code rather than XML *.config file.

The v1.3.1 simplifies configuration from the code using additional shortcut methods. It also improves handling for application virtual path root.",ThrottlingSuite.Http,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,"The Throttling Suite provides throttling control capabilities to the .NET Web API applications.

The basic unit of communication is a Notification, which is passed around to any and or all objects that implement the IReceive interface. Using Interfaces and ihneritance it is possible to pass around Notifications that have special meanings to certain objects and allow them to perform the appropriate function.

In our design Notifications are created and sent via a call to NotifyAll. Any object within the system can implement the IReceive interface and register itself with either a Queue (WIP) or a Transmitter to receive all notifications that are sent out. The underlying concept is that one part of a system knows that something needs to be done without needing to know how to do it. The part of the system that needs something done simply creates a notification and sends it out. Once received by the part of the system that is capable of performing the requested Notification the relevant actions will be carried out and a status of OK or Finished returned. See the section on return codes for a complete explanation of these codes and what they mean.
