In Academy.Collections you will not find any collection contained in the Microsoft .NET Base Class Library (System.Collections namespaces), those are pretty good implementations.

WebMarkupMin absorbed the best of existing solutions from non-microsoft platforms: Juriy Zaytsev's Experimental HTML Minifier (http://kangax.github.com/html-minifier/) (written in JavaScript) and Sergiy Kovalchuk's HtmlCompressor (http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/) (written in Java).

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C.aspx). The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://yuicompressor.codeplex.com).",WebMarkupMin.Core,False,2017-05-07T11:37:49.133-07:00,True,False,"The Web Markup Minifier (abbreviated WebMarkupMin) is a .NET library that contains a set of markup minifiers.
