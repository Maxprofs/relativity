DevForce fills this gap so you don't have to. Instead of building, maintaining, revising, and defending your application's infrastructure; you can focus on what you do best-application development.

DevForce implements end-to-end n-tier architecture by exposing a generic web service on the server that takes a LINQ expression and returns business objects to the client over the internet.

Write LINQ queries on the client and get back business objects with your own custom business logic-just like working with a 2-tier or client-server application.

DevForce handles all the n-tier WCF communications, serialization, and marshaling for you.

Inversion of Control
MicroMVVM leverages the Dependency Injection pattern, the framework fetches Transient and Singleton exportable services and injects these interfaces in the ViewModel's constructor.

Navigation
MicroMVVM.Navigation allows an easy way to navigate from one view to another from the ViewModels. Also provides the means to pass complex objects from one view to another.

Services
IConnectionService and ILayoutService are available in MicroMVVM.Services to notify the application when the internet connection has been lost and when the application layout has changed.
