I need a small framework that can work with a syslog server and NLog

Usage
Downlod the zip file or clone the repository.

If there is a NLog.config file present in the assembly library, it wil automatic start using NLog.

Log level
The Log Level is diveded up like this:

Emergency, Alert, Critical is equal to Fatal in NLog
Error is equal to Error in NLog
Warn is equal to Warn in NLog
Info is equal to Info in NLog
Debug is equal to Debug in NLog
Trace is equal to Trace in NLog
NLog Wrapper
It's possible to log in the same way as using NLog.

MaxNLog log = new MaxNLog();
log.Info(""Nlog Wrapper - Info"");
log.Debug(""NLog Wrapper - Debug"");
log.Error(""NLog Wrapper - Error"");
Initialize
Start with initialize the logging, it's a static class so only do it once.

The complete signature for initialize is:

public static void Initialize(string hostName, int port, string appName = """", Facility facility = Facility.User)
Facility is a static class with all the provided options.

For logging you just use:

Logger.Emergency(""Message"");
Notice that if you dont supply it with a tag then is use the assembly, class name and method in the tag section.

I need a small framework that can work with a syslog server and NLog

Usage
Downlod the zip file or clone the repository.

If there is a NLog.config file present in the assembly library, it wil automatic start using NLog.

Log level
The Log Level is diveded up like this:

Emergency, Alert, Critical is equal to Fatal in NLog
Error is equal to Error in NLog
Warn is equal to Warn in NLog
Info is equal to Info in NLog
Debug is equal to Debug in NLog
Trace is equal to Trace in NLog
NLog Wrapper
It's possible to log in the same way as using NLog.

MaxNLog log = new MaxNLog();
log.Info(""Nlog Wrapper - Info"");
log.Debug(""NLog Wrapper - Debug"");
log.Error(""NLog Wrapper - Error"");
Initialize
Start with initialize the logging, it's a static class so only do it once.

Syslog.Initialize(""192.168.0.2"", 514,""tag"");
The complete signature for initialize is:

public static void Initialize(string hostName, int port, string appName = """", Facility facility = Facility.User)
Facility is a static class with all the provided options.

For logging you just use:

Logger.Emergency(""Message"");
Notice that if you dont supply it with a tag then is use the assembly, class name and method in the tag section.
