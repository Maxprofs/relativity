      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your MVVM based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
