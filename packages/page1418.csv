LightningChart Ultimate is entirely GPU accelerated (Direct3D) and performance optimized data visualization control for presenting masses of data in 2D XY graph, 3D XYZ, polar and 3D pie / donut views. 

The chart control comes with huge set of data visualization types. 

XY Graph view
•	Renders huge amounts of measured data as graphs in real-time, very smoothly, up to hundreds of millions of new data points / sec.
•	High refresh rate even with heavy load
•	Renders vast data sets instantly
•	Series types: sampled data (discrete signal), point-line, freeform point-line, areas, high-low, polygon, stock series (candle-stick), bar, band, constant line, intensity grid, intensity mesh
•	Geographic maps can be combined with other XY view series and objects.
•	Intensity series are perfect e.g. for environmental data over maps and thermal imaging. Can be rendered inside selected polygons or map regions.
•	Zoom, pan and rotate operations
•	Built-in series tracking cursors
•	Series and chart event marker indicators
•	Unlimited X axes/chart, vertical position adjust
•	Unlimited Y axes/chart: stacked or layered
•	Different X-axis real-time monitoring scrolling modes: Scrolling, sweeping, stepping, oscilloscope style level triggered
•	Automatic scale fitting, grids and divisions
•	Fast scale setting with mouse, configurable zoom and pan buttons
•	Logarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1
•	Palette-colored line series by Y value
•	Persistent layers - extremely fast rendering of thousands of repetitive line series without rising CPU load or memory footprint
•	Persistent intensity layers - heat-map coloring of repetitive traces with hit-counters

3D XYZ View
•	Real 3D visualization
•	Series types: point-line, bar, surface mesh, surface grid, waterfall, mesh models
•	Gigantic surface sizes of over 2000x2000
•	Height/Toned/Point/Bitmap coloring for surfaces
•	3D rectangles with image fill
•	Contour lines and wireframing for surfaces and waterfall
•	Many lighting and shading options
•	3D models can be imported from CAD and modeling applications, as X-file
•	Polygons, rectangles
•	Perspective and orthographic 3D camera, with pre-defined setups
•	Zoom, pan and rotate operations, axis range adjust by mouse
•	Logarithmic axis scales, advanced features for minimal values between 0...1

Geographic maps and G.I.S.
•	Vector maps
•	On-line tile maps: supports street maps and satellite imagery by MapQuest/OpenStreetMaps
•	World, continents, specific areas
•	Dozens of maps
•	Multi-layer: land, lakes, rivers, roads, cities etc.
•	High/Mid/Low resolutions
•	Map import from ESRI shape file data
•	On-the-fly silent map layer replace/import for frequently updated SHP data
•	Polygon and vector based objects
•	Background images setting from satellite photos
•	Fast rendering
•	Mouse interactive objects
•	Several fill and style options: individual or common layer based
•	Many coordinate formats
•	Border points and other data can be accessed from objects
•	Digital elevation model (DEM) data can be presented with IntensityGrid (ViewXY) or IntensityGrid3D (View3D) series, with contour lines
•	3D models can placed in View3D

Polar view
•	Series types: area, point-line
•	Several amplitude and angle axes
•	Sectors
•	Markers

3D pies / donuts
•	Freely rotatable 3D visualization
•	Pie and donut styles
•	Dimension adjustment
•	Exploded slices
•	Mouse interactive

The chart control comes with huge set of data visualization types. 

XY Graph view
•	Renders huge amounts of measured data as graphs in real-time, very smoothly, up to hundreds of millions of new data points / sec.
•	High refresh rate even with heavy load
•	Renders vast data sets instantly
•	Series types: sampled data (discrete signal), point-line, freeform point-line, areas, high-low, polygon, stock series (candle-stick), bar, band, constant line, intensity grid, intensity mesh
•	Geographic maps can be combined with other XY view series and objects.
•	Intensity series are perfect e.g. for environmental data over maps and thermal imaging. Can be rendered inside selected polygons or map regions.
•	Zoom, pan and rotate operations
