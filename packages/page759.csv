      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

Decide the number of columns you want in a row & set the margin you want to use. Some sweet maths will do the heavy lifting for you.

Have Any Number of Columns
Don't be forced into having a fixed number of columns across a whole page. You can have whatever you want, wherever you need it.

Scales to Any Width
Because it uses percentages, your fluid columns will fit into any width. The margins (gutters) use percentages too.

It's Smart
There's no need to hack in any offsets or marginless final columns. It's the last time you need to use .last and the end of .end.

Put the Content First
Instead of fitting your content to your grid, you can make your grid suit your content. Doesn't that feel good?

It Fits In with You
It plugs into your existing HTML and CSS, and it's so easy to do so. It's your friend.

Simple Breakpoints
Mobile versions of the grid are already baked in, or you can cook up your own.

StructureMap can enable looser coupling between classes and their dependencies, improve the testability of a class structure, and provide generic flexibility mechanisms. Used judiciously, StructureMap can greatly enhance the opportunities for code reuse by minimizing direct coupling between classes and configuration mechanisms.",structuremap,False,2018-01-17T23:14:19.45+00:00,True,False,StructureMap is a Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control tool for .Net,,3481648,False,3.1.0.133
