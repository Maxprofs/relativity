Amit Patankar,2014-09-08T20:58:10.107Z,"A tiny C# class to handle arguments sent to a console application.
Tiny uses the power of dynamic and ExpandoObject in .Net 4 to dynamically populate name-value pairs from the arguments passed to the command line.
The inspiration from Tiny came from Rob Conery's Micro-Orm project - Massive, where he used the power of dynamic to display some really cool magic.
Tiny's argument parsing depends on separators for name-value pairs, for example if the command line for your app is:
c:\code\myapp\bin\myapp testargument1:testvalue testargument2:with_a:in_the_value testargument3
Note: The default separator for Tiny is ':'.
The code for parsing these arguments through Tiny is:
static void Main(string[] args) {
 Tiny t = new Tiny(args); 
}
You can read the passed arguments directly as properties via your code by writing code like this:
t.Arguments.testargument1;
t.Arguments.testargument2;
Any argument without a specified separator gets the name of UndefinedArgumentX where X is the number of the encountered argument without a separator.
In the above example, the last argument can be read via:

Named registering : You can also name them if you want to store several instances of a type or retrieve them easily by name.

Caching Strategy : by default you get new instances every time you try to get one. You can also keep alive instances and cache them.

EasyLocator uses Reflection to Resolve not registered types . Also registering ViewModels for example is not required. EasyLocator registers them and instanciates them for you . Only registering Services is really required (pair interface + implementation for example) because it can't resolves the ""preferred"" implementation .

GroupDocs,2014-08-29T14:16:56.347Z,"GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET is a flexible library that allows you to generate documents by filling out merge fields in PDF or Word templates with data obtained from a DB or user input. The library can be of great help if you need to generate lots of custom documents that have a standard template, but need to be filled out with unique data. These could be invoices, bills, order quotes, offer letters, NDAs, legal documents, insurance policies, etc.

The library comes with a web UI which allows end users to prepare templates and get the completed documents without any assistance from developers. Easy to follow wizards guide end users through the document assembly process, which includes the following steps:

1. Upload a template in a PDF, DOC or DOCX format with merge fields that should be populated with data.

2. Compose an online questionnaire associated with the merge fields in the template and publish it on the web.

3. Invite users to complete the questionnaire.

For each completed questionnaire a new unique document is generated. The document looks exactly like the template but includes data populated into the merge fields.

Key Features & Benefits:

-  Templates can be filled in with data obtained from web forms or a DB.
-  Support for different types of form fields: text box, check box, lists and combo, radio buttons, etc.
-  Ability to set default values and rules for questions (for example set value range and limits for respond length).
-  Ability to handle JavaScript events (for example onTemplateCreated, onTemplateMerge, etc.).
-  Documents are generated on-the-fly, each time a questionnaire is completed.
-  Convenient UI allows end users to generate documents without any assistance from developers.

For more details on the library, please visit GroupDocs website at: 
http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-assembly-library

Randolph Burt,2014-09-05T19:58:23.86Z,"TexturePacker (http://www.codeandweb.com) is a very easy to use application for creating Texture Atlases / Sprite Sheets.  The idea is that you draw the individual frames of animation for your game characters as separate image files and then drag and drop them into TexturePacker – whereupon you end up with a single image file and accompanying data file ready to load into your game.  Using a single sprite sheet is much more efficient than loading lots of individual images in game development. 

Now this maybe nothing new to a lot of people, however what you might not know, is that the latest version of TexturePacker has an option for exporting the sprite sheet and data file in a format targeted at MonoGame.  The next step is to then use this Nuget package in your MonoGame app in order to use the data files created by TexturePacker to create your animations with just a few lines of code.
