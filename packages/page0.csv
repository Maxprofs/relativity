		MvcMailer has a MailerBase class that extends ControllerBase class. So, Mailers are just like your Controllers.
		As a result, you can use all the controller goodies without any learning curve, period. The end result
		is a professional looking HTML email body ready for your to send to your website users.

		Here's a quick list of features:
		a) Use Razor/WebForms views
		b) Use Master pages
		c) Write Testable Code
