      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
	  - Xamarin.iOS
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:	  
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
	  - Parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Supports fluent syntax
      - Excellent performance",MugenMvvmToolkit.Android.API8.AppCompatV7,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",-1,False,1.1.3

      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
	  - Parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.

      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Xamarin.Android
	  - Xamarin.iOS
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:	  
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, ternary operator (?:), coalescing operator (??), etc. (Text Items.First(x => x == Name).Value), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args)), (DoubleClick Command).
      - Built-in support for validation. (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings. (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1)).
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
	  - Parser builds syntax tree that allows you to easily change or extend the bindings, without manipulation of the raw text.
      - Supports fluent syntax
      - Excellent performance",MugenMvvmToolkit.Android.API8.AppCompatV7,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform,ios",-1,False,1.1.0
