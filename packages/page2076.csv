ABCpdf operates two HTML rendering engines for insertion of HTML content. The MSHTML engine leverages IE as installed on the local machine. The Gecko runtime adds Firefox-style HTML rendering to the mix.

Placed HTML support means your HTML can be treated just like any other media - placed wherever you like on the page. Paged HTML support allows you to flow your HTML from one area to another - across pages or columns or both. A vast range of options gives you full control over the HTML rendering process and DOM.

In terms of features, probably most notably, the Gecko engine supports repeated table headers and footers. It is also extremely good on SVG and AJAX for charts and maps. The MSHTML engine tends to be faster and provides a more literal screen based output. Gecko generally supports modern HTML features better than MSHTML.",ABCpdf.ABCGecko,False,2018-03-21T11:16:28.893+00:00,True,False,,"ABCpdf,PDF,Acrobat,Gecko,HTML",52399,False,10.1.1.7
ABCpdf Team,2016-12-20T15:04:21.393Z,30,486,"ABCpdf is a powerful and flexible PDF component for .NET.

ABCpdf is a .NET component for PDF manipulation. As such, you'll find it documented for C# and VB.NET, with numerous PDF code examples and freely adaptable projects, all designed to help you get up to speed.

Re-use existing skills for PDF document layout. ABCpdf supports a wide range of layout methods, including HTML and CSS, System.Drawing, PostScript, and a powerful set of native drawing commands. Import SVG, DOCX, XPS, EPS, the usual bitmap image formats such as JPEG, TIFF, PSD and many more. And because support for these formats is built-in, ABCpdf makes light work of PDF related document conversion tasks.

Import HTML and CSS pages from local or remote web sites. Placed HTML support means your HTML can be treated just like any other media - placed wherever you like on your PDF page. Choose between the FireFox and Internet Explorer HTML rendering engines. A vast range of options gives you full control over the HTML rendering process and DOM.

ABCpdf is a robust component, with probably hundreds of thousands of live installations, and more than a decade's worth of support and development. But should you ever need help our PDF expert support team are on hand.

ABCpdf is fast. ABCpdf does not use a printer driver. Instead it goes Direct to PDF™, generating PDF documents on the fly. And fully multi-threaded, ABCpdf is suitable for use with ASP.NET.

ABCpdf supports Unicode and foreign languages, CJK fonts, and right-to-left text such as Arabic and Hebrew, kerning, tracking and contextual ligatures.

ABCpdf supports sophisticated color spaces. Mix and match RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, calibrated color spaces and spot colors. Any kind of graphic from text to lines to blocks of color can be drawn in in any of these color spaces. You can even perform complex operations like colorizing grayscale images using spot colors or converting from one color space to another.

PDF optimization and size reduction provides whole document optimization using a variety of options to reduce font sizes, remove embedded fonts, to resample and recompress images, to flatten wherever possible for the smallest possible output.

PDF analysis has been extended into easy-to-use operations for text and images. Simple on the surface but sophisticated underneath, they allow you to extract common-sense, de-hyphenated and de-ligatured text from PDFs. Then select items of that text within the PDF and perform operations on those selections.

PDF accessibility is now something that can be supported, even for PDFs which were never designed to do so. Standards such as PDF/UA and Section 508 compliance require that PDFs be accessible. Our accessibility operation performs a sophisticated semantic analysis of the document content and adds appropriate tagging information to produce an accessible Tagged PDF output.
