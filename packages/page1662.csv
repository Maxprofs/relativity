Maximus5,2016-06-06T00:07:47.56Z,1,683,"ConEmu-Maximus5 (short for Console Emulator) is a handy and full featured Windows console window (local terminal) with a lot of enhancements: panes, tabs, tasks, jump lists, quake style, handy text and block selection, handy paste of paths in either Unix or Windows notation, and much more.

ConEmu.Core package contains only essential files - no extras, no Far Manager plugins, no documentation. Full distro and docs are available on the project site.

ConEmu may work as either standalone window, or embeddable console control. And it may host two types of applications:
* ‘console’: cmd, powershell, Far Manager, bash, and many others;
* ‘graphical’ (GUI): Notepad, PuTTY, GVim, mintty and so on.

Short list of features:
* predefined and user-defined tasks for different shells;
* user friendly text and block selection and paste;
* smooth and friendly window resizing;
* Windows 7 Jump Lists and Progress on Taskbar buttons;
* DosBox integration: run old DOS applications (games) in modern OS;
* quake-style and full screen window modes;
* ANSI sequences and Xterm 256 colors;
* cursor: standard console (horizontal) or GUI (vertical);
* customizable starting tabs;
* Far Manager integration: drag-n-drop, tabs, truecolor, thumbnails;
* unicode and CJK support;

Wouldn’t it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight’s most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand.

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don’t really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight’s Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

In order to use this library you must have the ReflectInsight Viewer installed. Download and install the ReflectInsight Viewer from this location:

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and over 100x faster than AE.Net.Mail and MailSystem.NET).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.
