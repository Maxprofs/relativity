      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes binaries only. You should use this package for test projects or assemblies that need to interact with types in Blue.MVVM.
      For a head start, use Blue.MVVM (http://www.nuget.org/packages/Blue.MVVM/) instead.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      + XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo
      - many more...

      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
      - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
      - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues

      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      + XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo
      - many more...

      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your MVVM based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes a partial class for use in your projects, which should be used as a base class for your notification-enabled class-hierarchy.
      This way you can extend Blue.MVVM with functionality that may be released in future updates, possibly preventing breaking changes that may be occur between releases.
      Also, future udates may use the partial class as an extension point.


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      - XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo

earloc,2014-03-22T23:34:43.65Z,"Snippets on the fly! Manage C# code snippets on solution level

      _about this package_

      This package will enable you to manage and maintain solution agnostic C# code snippets. In other words, snippets in a solution will be deployed automatically upon build - so you can manage snippets on a ""per solution"" basis.
      Just drop the *.snippet files that should be availabe to developers of your solution anywhere under the solution folder.
      SolutionSnippets will discover all those files and deploy them into a special folder ""__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets"" to the current user´s snippet folder.
      (this would be ""{Documents}\Visual Studio 2012\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets\__Blue.Utils.SolutionSnippets"", where {Documents} is the local user´s documents library.
      This way, SolutionSnippets won´t interfere with already existing snippets.

      It is totally sufficient when there is exactly one project within your solution that installs SolutionSnippets, as all snippets-files under your solution folder will be deployed.

      All you need to do to deploy your solution agnostic snippets is to start a build.
      When building your solution, all existing solution agnostic snippets are removed.
      After that, all snippets in the scope of the current solution are deployed to your user´s snippet folder
      (remember: SolutionSnippets does not touch any existing snippets)

      _under the hood_
      
      There is (sadly) no black magic involved in deploying solution agnostic snippets. The main work is done by common msbuild-tasks. Only resolving the local user´s snippet folder is done by a custom build-task.
      
      _known caveats_

      Under certain circumstances Visual Studio does not reflect changes to snippets immediatly. In those cases, just restart the Visual Studio instance.
      In the meantime, go vote for this feature: http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4152530-add-the-ability-to-refresh-individual-or-all-snipp
