IronOCR is an advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) & Barcode reading engine for ASP.NET. 

The library allows developers to add OCR functions to Desktop, Console and Web applications.

IronOCR pre-processes images to read scans with low resolution, paper distortion and background noise by resolving issues with rotation, skew, noise, contrast, color, and setting crop regions.

* Auto OCR automatically detects image quality before reading document. 
* Advanced OCR provides developers with settings to adjust advanced image processing.

Output as plain text and barcode data or access advanced object model that splits page content into headings, paragraphs, lines, words and characters.

Multi-lingual version includes language packs for Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish. Individual langauge packs and code examples  available at http://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/
