SageSerpent Ltd,2014-02-17T20:38:00.383Z,"This is a .NET library that generates sets of test cases, for use by parameterised tests.

Each test case is built up progressively from smaller pieces of data that are combined together.

The smallest pieces are referred to as 'test variables'. Each test variable is constrained to take values from its own set of allowed 'levels'.

Changing each test variable independently to a new level produces a new test case.

If a test requires a certain 'strength' of coverage of combinations of levels from different test variables, the library produces a stream of test cases that honour this guarantee while avoiding getting swamped with a combinatoric explosion of test cases.

If a parameterised test fails with an exception for a specific test case, the library creates a signature that allows it to reproduce the failing test case immediately in a separate test; this is to aid debugging.

The sources are written in F#, but the API can be used just as comfortably from C# as from F#.

The documentation is on the front page of the GitHub site: https://github.com/sageserpent-open/NTestCaseBuilder.
