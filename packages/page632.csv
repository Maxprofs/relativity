      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v3 features: more queries per connection, timestamp property, UDT and Tuple types, larger collections
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Extremely fast, highly flexible and extendable type (conversion) system. Automatically converts parameters and results to the requested types.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
