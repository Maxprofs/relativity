Arkadeep De,2016-12-06T17:14:07.687Z,497,500,"DoLog is a logging application which helps you to log in a CSV file by just plugged in. Install it through Nuget package and your logging functionality is ready. 

Steps to Add DoLog:
1. Run the command from Nuget package manager console.

2. Add the namespace 
using DoLogLibrary; // put it in namespace section

3. For windows applications, you don't need to set the log file location path. For web application write the below code in App_Start method in Global.ascx.
DoLog.SetLogLocation(Server.MapPath(""~"")); // Set the location of log file for web application 

4. For Logging use method Log under DoLog class. This is a static method, so you don't need to create any kind of object.
Examples:
DoLog.Log(""Application Starts"");
DoLog.Log(ex.Message,""Error"");
DoLog.Log(""Application Ends"", ""Info"");

""Log"" takes two parameters. first one is the message and second one is the level of message(like info, warning,error or any thing user puts).  

Method returns a tuple<bool, string>
first items state whether logging operation is successful or not, and second item states the location of log file.
