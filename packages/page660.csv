Picoe Software Solutions Inc.,2014-11-14T08:21:32.32Z,"Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:

- Eto.Platform.Wpf
- Eto.Platform.Windows
- Eto.Platform.Direct2D
- Eto.Platform.Gtk
- Eto.Platform.Gtk3
- Eto.Platform.Mac
- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.

The library comes with a web UI that allows you to display differences between documents with a redline change tracking view. The UI can easily be customized and integrated into your own app. You can also build your own UI from scratch or use the library without the UI at all.

Key Features Include:

1. GroupDocs.Comparison identifies not only differences in document contents, but styles changes, including bold/italic, underlines, strikethroughs, font type, etc.

2. Once documents are merged, the library generates a diff summary, listing all the changes found.

3. The library allows you to compare up to 3 Word (DOC/DOCX) files. It also shows which changes come from what document.

4. When comparing Word documents, changes can be accepted or rejected and the result exported to a final document.

5. You can upload documents from streams and send the result output to streams as well.

For more details on the library, please visit the GroupDocs website at: 
http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-comparison-library

			The overall goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

			For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

			This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

			In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:

			- Eto.Platform.Wpf
			- Eto.Platform.Windows
			- Eto.Platform.Gtk
			- Eto.Platform.Mac
