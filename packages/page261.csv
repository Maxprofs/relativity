		* IStatsdClient interface for easy mocking in unit tests
		* Allows for customisation of every output stat to do things like screen metrics before sending
		* Supports a user-defined prefix to prepend to every metric		
    * Outputs to UDP or TCP 

    .Net 4.0 and 4.5 Users:

      If you build websites and you use the JQuery NuGet package you have to remember to NOT update your JQuery. In addition other packages that have not been
      tested with verson 2 can use this package as a depedency instead of JQuery to prevent project update errors.
      
      Updating JQuery will update your package to version 2+ of JQuery. This package is JQuery1 and can be installed along with jQuery in the same project. 
      At the top of your View you would then include a directive for example like this.
      
      
          <!--[if lt IE9]
              <script src=""jquery-1.10.1.js""></script>

          <!--<![endif]-->
      
      
      According to JQuery there will be new versions of JQuery 1.x in the future.  This package will be updated to reflect that change and ease deployment.
      
      Updated in this minor update is better support for Project using SCC.

      if it isn't already checked out before modification.
