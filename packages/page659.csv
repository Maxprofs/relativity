- Fully managed code, platform independent and without reference to other libraries. 
- ACID compliant. 
- Multi-threaded, with a solution for deadlocks resolving/elimination, parallel reads and synchronized writes/reads. 
- No fixed scheme for table names (construction and access on the fly).
- Tables can reside in mixed locations: different folders, hard drives, memory.
- Database indexes (keys) never need to be defragmented. Speed of insert/update/remove operations doesn't grow up during the time.
- Ability to access Key/Value pair of a table by physical link, what can economize time for joining necessary data structures.
- No limits for database size (except ""long"" size for each table and physical resources constraints).
- Low memory and physical space consumption, also while random inserts and updates. Updates reside the same physical space, if possible.
- High performance of CRUD operations. When you need, unleash DBreeze power and get 500000 key/value pairs insert or 260K updates per second per core into sorted table on the hard drive of standard PC.
- High speed of random keys batch insert and updates (batch must be sorted in memory ascending and non-overwrite flag must be set).
- Range selects / Traversing (Forward, Backward, From/To, Skip, StartsWith etc). Remove keys, change keys.
- Keys and values, on the low level, are always byte arrays. 
- Max. key size is 65KB, max. value size is 2GB. Value can be represented as a set of columns, where can be stored data types of fixed or dynamic length. Every dynamic datablock can be of size 2GB. 
- Rich set of conversion functions from/to between byte[] and other data types.
- Nested / Fractal tables which can reside inside of master tables values.
- Incremental backup/restore option.
- DBreeze is a foundation for complex data storage solutions (graph/neuro, object, document, text search etc. data layers).

Microsoft Quality Engineering and Design (QED),2014-11-12T19:26:16.343Z,1226,1255,"This is a convenient WinRT API for making Internet connection state decisions in real time, using the speed result to decide if/when to run your network-intensive code. This is all about speed and latency, so you will need to test throughput if that is important to your application. This API does not need to eat a bunch of network bandwidth to do it's job. 



InternetConnectionState fills a small gap in the Windows platform networking APIs by providing developers a very easy to use, simple abstraction to measure current Internet connection speed, something most apps today are not doing, which ends up in potentially poor experiences for people using apps that make connectivity state assumptions based only on the existence of an active Internet connection.



This API will benefit the people using your app, who should always be shielded from network latency under all circumstances. Developers - developers are people! - will also benefit as you can be confident that: 



a) The easy-to-use API will return a result very quickly, as any API call should
