Lenny Granovsky,2014-07-10T01:59:36.567Z,"The ""Web API Correlator"" enables correlation functionality for Web API and interconnected Web API services within a service composition.

With the increasing complexity of modern distributed SOA systems containing interconnected services, it becomes crucial to determine causal relationships between the services and its clients. It is important to understand the various components that were part of a request flow to support critical scenarios such as health monitoring, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis. For this reason many frameworks provide correlation capability. For example, WCF has built-in correlation functionality. 

Although Web API creates (Request.GetCorrelationId()) and carries the Correlation Id throughout the HTTP request handling process, taking care of thread context switches as part of asynchronous nature of processing Web API requests, the boundary for this Correlation Id is limited to a single server-side request-response cycle. In other words, the Correlation Id Web API provides ""out of the box"" is limited to a single service boundary. In essence, Web API lacks ability to correlate processes between client and server, as well as interconnected services chains applicable to many distributed SOA applications. Effectively, we lose ability to relate multiple events immediately as a process crosses the service boundary; the information about multiple linked events within the system become dispersed data records rather representing the related nature of those events. 

The ""Web API Correlator"" enables absent functionality by transferring the Correlation Id from API Client (browser or .NET HttpClient, or .NET WebClient) to the server, propagating it into the server-side Web API process, and forwarding to interconnected Web API services within a service composition.

The ""Web API Correlator"" contains correlation component for .NET, and offers a plugin for jQuery AJAX. The jQuery plug-in manages and maintains the Correlation Id on the client-side and ensures the Correlation Id being added to all AJAX requests.

Lenny Granovsky,2014-06-08T14:13:47.163Z,"The Throttling Suite provides throttling control capabilities to the .NET Web API applications. It is highly customizable product, yet simple to use. The implementation supports all available hosting options provisioning equal functionality for IIS-hosted and OWIN self-hosted solutions. It is specifically designed to throttle high performance and high throughput Web API applications.

The library contains multiple controller types implementing different throttling algorithms:
Linear throttling - limits the number of calls by enforcing consistent delay between consequent requests;
Short Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; it does not intend to limit the overall number of requests, but rather assures blocking excessive requests; this strategy is very helpful to cut the requests floods;
Long Average - limits the number of calls by specified number of requests per configured duration; this strategy limits an overall number of calls within long time duration; this is also known as applying penalty to the client for excessive application use.

Each throttling controller is capable of unique client determination and management. The throttling for any end-point, or set of end-points can be configured either for the entire application, or per-client. It does not purely rely on client IP address, allowing multiple clients from the same network concurrently making requests to the server. 
The Throttling Suite allows setting multiple controllers within the application and applying each to a pre-filtered traffic. The filters are also configurable.

The Throttling Suite provides two modes: real blocking mode when request is blocked with 429 HTTP Status code and log-only mode.

The code is highly optimized having very low memory impact. The throttling evaluation functionality takes less than 0.3 ms to run.

The v1.2 is updated to include ""Retry-After"" response header in the blocked response helping API client to negotiate the request rate with API server side. 

The v1.2 also allows to ignore the actual request URL substituting one with Throttling controller instance scope. This provides the benefit to count requests for multiple API endpoints toward the same throttling threshold.

The v1.3 enables configuration from the code rather than XML *.config file.",ThrottlingSuite.Http,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,"The Throttling Suite provides throttling control capabilities to the .NET Web API applications.

OctopusContrib.NewRelic is a package for creating an Octopus Deploy release candidate for installing New Relic. The package can install the New Relic Server Monitor and the New Relic .NET Agent.

How to get started:
Step 1: Download OctopusContrib.NewRelic

Download the OctopusContrib.NewRelic NuGet package from NuGet.Org or download directly from github.

Step 2: Alter NuSpec

Alter the NuSpec file and give it an ID that matches your application. You can have a single package for all your Octopus projects, a more secure approach is to let each project generate their own New Relic package, hence avoiding unwanted installations

Step 3: Create Octopus Variables

The installation script (deploy.ps1) supports a number of variables:

NewRelicAgentApiKey: Mandatory. The New Relic API key
NewRelicApplicationName: Optional. By convention the installation script will concat the Octopus project name and the Environment. E.g. 'MyApp Staging"". If NewRelicApplicationName is set, this will be used instead. Note that this name will be configured in the newrelic.xml configuration file. If you host more than 1 application on the IIS, then add the AppSetting NewRelic.AppName with your application name. For more information se the New Relic documentation https://newrelic.com/docs/dotnet/AgentDocumentation.
NewRelicIisReset: Optional. If set to 'true' the package will perform an IIS reset after installing New Relic. Note this is required, to let New Relic hook into the IIS. If not specified, an IIS reset will not be performed.
Step 4: Replace installers

Optionally replace the New Relic Server Monitor and Agent installer with the newest version.

Step 5: Create Octopus Release Candidate

Invoke CreateOctopusPackage.ps1 (or just use NuGet.exe) to create the Octopus Release Candidate. This script will optionally let you upload to your Octopus Release Candidate NuGet repository",OctopusContrib.NewRelic,False,2014-07-10T13:02:00.887-07:00,True,False,,,1718,False,1.1.0

It is a productive library for manipulating image data in an efficient way. The features include decoding and encoding JPEG images, applying filters, cropping, rotating and resizing. The SDK - available for Windows Phone 8.x and Windows 8.1 - provides more than 50 pre-made filters and effects. The SDK is highly optimized to be super-fast by meticulous memory and code optimization. The patented JPEG technology, RAJPEG, contributes to making this possible, as it allows access to any image data without decoding the whole image. That means you can apply effects to high resolution images, without worrying about your memory budget.

You can even use TinyXML-2 to stream XML programmatically from code without creating a document first.
		TinyXML-2 is designed to be easy and fast to learn. It is one header and one cpp file. Simply add these to your project and off you go. There is an example file - xmltest.cpp - to get you started.
		TinyXML-2 is released under the ZLib license, so you can use it in open source or commercial code. The details of the license are at the top of every source file.
		TinyXML-2 attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and compliant XML output. TinyXML-2 should compile on any reasonably C++ compliant system. It does not rely on exceptions, RTTI, or the STL.
