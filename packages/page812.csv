How to use with a ""getting started"" example is in the visual studio template on the same page at the button.

Quick info:
Search for Windows using WindowFinder.Search, for searching of UI elements in it use UI.GetChild.
The UI element then has a lot of information and can be used with the MouseEx and KeyboardEx.

There can be some problems with dll files if used in a standard CodedUI project, I recommend to use the given template.
Its a standard UnitTest project with all needed dll files referenced and added.

1. Create new unit test project
2. Add some references (see template)
3. Add the dll file ""interop.*"" explicitelly (see template) (If you don't it will not work properly since MS put two objects with the same names in two different dlls
4. Add new test class
5. Change the attribute [TestClass] to [CodedUITest]


The first start might be hard, but using this dll brings a performance benefit with abot 300% alongside the MS CodedUI recordings and it is much more easy to use and changeable.

Application developers that need this functionality should instead reference the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource NuGet package which provides an enhanced developer experience.

      This package enables defining a strongly typed specification of an ETW provider that can be called by managed code. The EventSource class is also included in the .NET Framework. This package provides a newer version that has more features. It is meant to be used as a stop gap until those features it contains are ported to System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.

      For more details, have a look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx.

      New features:
      - ETW channel support
      - Support for static registration

      Supported Platforms:
      - .NET Framework 3.5
      - .NET Framework 4.0
      - .NET Framework 4.5
      - Windows Store apps
