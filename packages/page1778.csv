Enigma simplifies the use of the most popular and recurrent cryptographic operations and algorithms like hashing with SHA256 or encrypting/decrypting with RSA15 and X509 certificates.

The VideoView control uses native controls on each platform. VideoView for Android, AVPlayerViewController for iOS, and MediaElement for UWP.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView.Source property is of type ImageSource. This means you can set the VideoView.Source in the same way you would set the Image.Source property, including being able to use ImageSource.FromResource().

****************
Sample Application is now available at:
----------------
https://github.com/Rod-at-Rox/RoxXamarinVideo
****************
In your iOS project ""AppDelegate"" code file, you must call ""Rox.VideoIos.Init()"" before ""Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init()"". It should look something like:
----------------
Rox.VideoIos.Init();

global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init();

LoadApplication(new MyVideoApplication());
****************
The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)
----------------
The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - ImageSource Source { get; set; } (See Xamarin article ""Working with Images"")
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)
 - ICommand PropertyChangedCommand { get; set; } (Executes a command when any of the VideoView properties change)

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - ICommand VideoStateChangedCommand { get; set; } (Executes the command when the VideoState changes)
 - ImageSource VideoSource { get; set; } (See Xamarin article ""Working with Images"")
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-29T15:01:05.337Z,549,630,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control. Supports Android, iOS, and UWP.

The VideoView control uses native controls on each platform. VideoView for Android, AVPlayerViewController for iOS, and MediaElement for UWP.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView.Source property is of type ImageSource. This means you can set the VideoView.Source in the same way you would set the Image.Source property, including being able to use ImageSource.FromResource().

XAML Usage:
