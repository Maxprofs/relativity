- When going from small screen to large screen after selecting a menuitem the sidebar contained no menuitems

- When clicking on a menuitem in a small screen the menu now closes

Version 2.1:
* Removed .js files, use Web Essentials VS plugin to recreate them

* Fixed the startup spinner not showing

* Fixed an error with logFn, causing it to only log 'info' messages

Version 2:
* Changed naming of directives to be similar to their use: ""cc-widget-close""

The library can be of great help if you need to generate lots of custom documents that have a standard template, but need to be filled out with unique data. These could be invoices, bills, order quotes, offer letters, NDAs, legal documents, insurance policies, etc.

The library comes with a web UI which allows end users to prepare templates and get the completed documents without any assistance from developers. Easy to follow wizards guide end users through the document assembly process, which includes the following steps:

1. Upload a template in a PDF, DOC or DOCX format with merge fields that should be populated with data.

2. Compose an online questionnaire associated with the merge fields in the template and publish it on the web.

3. Invite users to complete the questionnaire.

For each completed questionnaire a new unique document is generated. The document looks exactly like the template but includes data populated into the merge fields.

Key Features & Benefits:

Templates can be filled in with data obtained from web forms or a DB.
Support for different types of form fields: text box, check box, lists and combo, radio buttons, etc.
Ability to set default values and rules for questions (for example set value range and limits for respond length).
Ability to handle JavaScript events (for example onTemplateCreated, onTemplateMerge, etc.).
Documents are generated on-the-fly, each time a questionnaire is completed.
Convenient UI allows end users to generate documents without any assistance from developers.

GroupDocs,2014-07-31T13:44:48.027Z,1117,1359,"GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET is a flexible library that allows you to generate documents by filling out merge fields in PDF or Word templates with data obtained from a DB or user input. The library can be of great help if you need to generate lots of custom documents that have a standard template, but need to be filled out with unique data. These could be invoices, bills, order quotes, offer letters, NDAs, legal documents, insurance policies, etc.

The library comes with a web UI which allows end users to prepare templates and get the completed documents without any assistance from developers. Easy to follow wizards guide end users through the document assembly process, which includes the following steps:

1. Upload a template in a PDF, DOC or DOCX format with merge fields that should be populated with data.

2. Compose an online questionnaire associated with the merge fields in the template and publish it on the web.

3. Invite users to complete the questionnaire.

For each completed questionnaire a new unique document is generated. The document looks exactly like the template but includes data populated into the merge fields.

Key Features & Benefits:

 - Templates can be filled in with data obtained from web forms or a DB.
 - Support for different types of form fields: text box, check box, lists and combo, radio buttons, etc.
 - Ability to set default values and rules for questions (for example set value range and limits for respond length).
 - Ability to handle JavaScript events (for example onTemplateCreated, onTemplateMerge, etc.).
 - Documents are generated on-the-fly, each time a questionnaire is completed.
 - Convenient UI allows end users to generate documents without any assistance from developers.

- When going from small screen to large screen after selecting a menuitem the sidebar contained no menuitems

- When clicking on a menuitem in a small screen the menu now closes
