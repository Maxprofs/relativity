Spire.Doc for .NET is a totally independent .NET Word class library which doesn't require Microsoft Office installed on system. Microsoft Office Automation is proved to be unstable, slow and not scalable to produce MS Word documents. Spire.Doc for .NET is many times faster than Microsoft Word Automation and with much better stability and scalability. 

By using Spire.Doc for .NET, users can save Word Doc/Docx to stream, save as web response and convert Word Doc/Docx to XML, RTF, EMF, TXT, XPS, EPUB, HTML and vice versa. Spire.Doc for .NET also supports to convert Word Doc/Docx to PDF and HTML to image. 

A common use of Spire.Doc for .NET is to create Word document dynamically from scratch. Almost all Word document elements are supported. Mainly includes page, sections, headers, footers, footnotes, paragraphs, lists, tables, text, fields, hyperlinks, bookmarks, comments, images, styles, background settings, printing features, document settings and protection. Furthermore, drawing objects including shapes, textboxes, images, OLE objects and controls are supported as well.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options
  * Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict, Section 508 and WCAG AAA compliant markup
  * Visual Studio .NET 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 and 2003 Designer support
  * Medium trust environment support for shared servers
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET MVC 5, ASP.NET MVC 4, ASP.NET MVC 3, ASP.NET MVC 2, and ASP.NET MVC 1 applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET WebForms applications

Apache Software Foundation,2014-04-24T01:36:48.17Z,"log4net is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets. In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With log4net it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. 

At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity. 

log4net is designed with two distinct goals in mind: speed and flexibility.
