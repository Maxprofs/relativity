Yan Cui,2015-05-06T14:42:53.077Z,"A SQL-like external DSL for querying and scanning data in Amazon DynamoDB.

      Although there exists a number of different ways to query and scan a DynamoDB table with the
      .Net AWS SDK:

      - with the low-level AmazonDynamoDBClient class
      - with the Table helper class
      - with the DynamoDBContext class

      none of these ways of querying and scanning tables are easy to use, and an external DSL is
      desperately needed to make it easier to express the query one would like to perform against
      data stored in DynamoDB.

      It is because of these limitations that I decided to add a SQL-like external DSL on top of
      existing functionalities of the AWS SDK to make it easier for .Net developers to work with
      DynamoDB, which is a great product despite the lack of built-in support for a good
      query language.",DynamoDb.SQL,False,2016-10-25T13:16:59.38-07:00,True,False,A SQL-like external DSL for querying and scanning data in Amazon DynamoDB.,"aws,amazon,cloud,dynamodb,parser,fsharp,f#,c#,csharp,combinator,sql,dsl",11561,False,2.1.0
