Samay is a free & simple to use stand-alone system automating all your .NET scheduling needs. It completely replaces Windows© Services & Windows© Task Scheduler for scheduling background tasks like reporting, maintenance, nightly runs, timers and other cron-like jobs. 

Documentation
For detailed documentation and download, please go to the official project website here: http://dotnetscheduler.com/engine

.NET Scheduler Features:

* Create Unlimited Jobs with Unlimited Reusable Tasks inside each Job using your favorite .NET language like C# or VB.net
* Supports repetitve and fixed number of executions of Jobs. Allows for repetition interval to the millisecond and also on the clock for special need jobs.
* Automate simple to the most complicated Tasks in .NET inheriting the 'TaskBase' class.
* Support for reusable Tasks. Create Task chain in your Jobs and pass data through the Task Chain.
* Support for extensive logging built in for your Tasks.
* Samay makes Full & Efficient Use of Hardware Infrastructure & CPU Cores. The abstraction layers makes it really easy to create custom jobs of any complexity.

Highly Flexible Job Scheduling:

* Each Job can have one or more of the following Schedules to the minute...
* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* Yearly
* One-Time
* Support for Overnight Schedules.
* Exclude Dates - Supports both Global Exclude Dates (Holidays) and Job specific dates",SamayScheduler,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,Samay is a free & simple to use stand-alone system automating all your .NET scheduling needs.
