Rob Reynolds,2011-11-20T14:36:01.983Z,"Chocolatey - think executables/application packages (like apt-get for Windows), not library packages. This is what the Chocolatey NuGet goodness is for.
Chocolatey allows you to install application nuggets and run executables from anywhere.  
||Executable Nuggets| For example, say you have an executable in the tools folder of your package named bob.exe. Then you can type
'chocolatey install yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst yourPackageName [-source source] [-version version]'
and when it finishes you can type
'bob'
and it will run your application executable.  
||Application Nuggets - Full on double rainbow|| For example, say you type 
'chocolatey install 7zip [-source source] [-version version]' OR 'cinst 7zip [-source source] [-version version]'
