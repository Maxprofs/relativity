If you're one of us, you have to use the CustomBinding to query the database, reporting some criteria for sort, group and filter the income data, and then convert back the result to a list of ViewModels.

Sounds simple, but can become a very complicated and repetitive task.

So I, with the help of some friends from Telerik MVC forum, create a way to automate this process in a very general way.
