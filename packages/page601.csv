2. Must have the ability to automatically mock any dependencies we wish to use with our item under test
3. Must have the ability to override automatic mocking should the need arise
4. Must support a clean syntax for stubbing method calls on our dependencies
5. Must have a clean BDD style Given/When/Then flow
