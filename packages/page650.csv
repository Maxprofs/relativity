"Rob Reynolds,The Chocolatey Team",2014-11-04T16:09:03.403Z,8,1263,"Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get but for Windows). It was designed to be a decentralized framework for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages from the distros to your door, err computer.

Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work and thankless nights of the Chocolatey Team (https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/members), and Rob heading up the direction.

You can host your own sources and add them to chocolatey, you can extend chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.

### Commands
There are quite a few commands you can call - you should check out the command reference at: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CommandsReference

 * Search - choco search something
 * List - choco list -lo
 * Install - choco install baretail
 * Update - choco update baretail
 * Uninstall - choco uninstall baretail
 * Install ruby gem - choco install compass -source ruby
 * Install python egg - choco install sphynx -source python
 * Install windows feature - choco install IIS -source windowsfeatures
 * Install webpi feature - choco install IIS7.5Express -source webpi

More advanced commands and switches listed on the command reference, including how you can force a package to install the x86 version of a package.

### Create Packages?
We have some great guidance on how to do that. Where? I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with sticky! https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages

In that mess there is a link to the Helper Reference - https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/HelpersReference

InjectionMap allows loose coupling betweeen a client's dependencies and its own behaviour. InjectionMap promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of any part of an application.
InjectionMap supports .Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 or higher and Windows Store apps for Windows 8 or higher.

- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. 
- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.
- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.
- The desired Constructors can be marked with attributes or will be selected according to the passed arguments.
- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping as objects or as delegate expressions.
- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.

JSON Patch (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) defines a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document; it is suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method. The ""application/json-patch+json"" media type is used to identify such patch documents.

One of the things this can be used for is partial updates for REST-ful API's, or, to quote the IETF: ""This format is also potentially useful in other cases in which it is necessary to make partial updates to a JSON document or to a data structure that has similar constraints (i.e., they can be serialized as an object or an array using the JSON grammar).""

That's what this package is all about.

AD is different from numerical differentiation, which is prone to truncation and round-off errors, and symbolic differentiation, which is exact but not efficient for run-time calculations and can only handle closed-form mathematical expressions.

Using the DiffSharp library, derivative calculations can be incorporated with minimal change into existing algorithms.

Christian Walpen,2014-11-04T21:52:43.1Z,919,1263,"InjectionMap is a very small and extremely lightweight IoC/DI container for .NET.  
InjectionMap allows loose coupling betweeen a client's dependencies and its own behaviour. InjectionMap promotes reusability, testability and maintainability of any part of an application.
InjectionMap supports .Net 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 or higher and Windows Store apps for Windows 8 or higher.

- InjectionMap uses type mapping to reference the key/reference and the implementation. 
- Instances are resolved using reflection or can be provided through a callback whitch allows you to create the instance in your own code.
- It suports a fluent syntax to help keep the code simple, small and clean.
- The desired Constructors can be marked with attributes or will be selected according to the passed arguments.
- Parameters for constructors can be injected or passed at the time of mapping as objects or as delegate expressions.
- InjectionMap is very simple and straightforward.

Bugs, issues or feature wishes can submitted on https://github.com/InjectionMap/InjectionMap on the issues page or feel free to fork the project and send a pull request.",InjectionMap,False,2015-10-14T12:11:33.817-07:00,True,False,A small and lightweight IoC/DI container for .NET.,"InjectionMap,IoC,DI",7555,False,1.5.4
