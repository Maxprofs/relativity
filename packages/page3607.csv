** Medical Viewing and Annotation **

The LEADTOOLS Medical Viewer Control is a high-level component for developers to build medical display solutions such as view stations, teleradiology applications, and high-end diagnostic workstations found in radiology and other medical specialty departments.  Whether you are building a PACS viewer for radiology, cardiology, mammography, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology, dentistry, or any other specialty, the DICOM Viewer Control eliminates complexity from your projects and sets a solid DICOM and imaging foundation on which you can rely.  For an HTML5/JavaScript Zero-footprint version of the Medical Viewer, go to https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/html5

LEADTOOLS DICOM Annotations provides two different means for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS annotations in a DICOM data set.

   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).

   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.


** 3D Reconstruction and Visualization **

LEADTOOLS Medical 3D Technology offers many different data representations using various 3D reconstruction techniques such as MPR, VRT, MIP, MinIP, and SSD, and projection techniques that support clipping planes, slab, scale, zoom, camera control, threshold, transparency, and image processing.


** DICOM Data Set **

LEADTOOLS provides complete support for DICOM data sets described in the latest DICOM specification and supplements, including all IOD classes and modalities such as CR, CT, MR, NM, US, RF, SC, and VL.


** Image Processing **

LEADTOOLS includes libraries that offer an advanced set of functions specially designed to enhance and analyze medical images regardless of the format or data distribution. You can enhance the image or highlight the details by shifting, selecting, subtracting, and removing the background. This flexibility allows doctors and specialists to diagnose diseases and injuries faster and more accurately.
