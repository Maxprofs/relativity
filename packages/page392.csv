This deliberate usurpation of defined concepts of equality is normally counter-productive. It is however useful in the following cases:
1. A hash-based structure such as a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> is used to associate objects with another which may be equivalent to another using the same dictionary.
2. A hash-based structure such as a Dictionary<TKey, TValue> is used to associate objects with another which may mutate in such a way as to change the hash code based on its defined concept of equality.
3. As a (risky) optimisation, when it is known that no other equivalent objects exist, and therefore this object is the only one that would return true for an equality check.
