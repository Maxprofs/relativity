Rik Svendsen Rose,2016-11-25T08:35:49.17Z,23,511,"I made this project to fix the contradictory concepts behind the Repository and UnitOfWork patterns together with using inversition of control / dependancy injection. Also i wanted to make the resolving of sessions (IDbConnection) and UnitOFWork's (IDbTransaction) automatically connection / begin transaction on creation, and disconnect/commit on disposal.
Also i wanted the usage of the session and uow to become nice and simple.

Included interfaces with abstractions:

1. **IDbFactory** is a simple interface that you register with your IoC. It can create/spwan ISession's and IUntOfWork's. But primary used in code to spawn sessions.
2. **ISession>TDatabase<** extends IDbConnection. You use it to extend your Database connection / Session type. Yours session classes and interfaces require a connection string. So If you have multiple database connections, you need 1 ISession and Session extended Interface and class per database. When the session is created by the factory it connects to the database, when it disposes it discontects and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the session for any IDbConnection or dapper (or extension) framework you like, as ISession extends IDbConnection ;-). 
3. **IUnitOfWork** extends IDbTransaction. You dont need to extend anything with this. When you have created a session in you code, you can create a uow from the session. Then the session is created by the factory it begins a transaction (isolation i a parameter), when it disposes it commits (roleback on exception) and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the transaction for any IDbTransaction work you like as IUnitOfWork extends IDbConnection ;-).
4. **IRepository>TSession, TEntity, TPk<** is a default repository that you extend with your own repository for each of the entities you want a repository for. There as some built in methods for GetAll, Get, and SaveOrUpdate. You can add the methods you need for your entity using any IDbConnection framework. I have used [dapper-dot-net](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) and [dapper.FastCRUD](https://github.com/MoonStorm/Dapper.FastCRUD) for the quering.

  * Removal listeners
  * LRU-based eviction
  * Time-since-last-read eviction
  * Time-since-last-write eviction
  * Typed keys and values
 
# Validation
Validations inspired by [Apache's Validate](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/Validate.html), with configurable failure modes


# Random
ThreadLocal random implementations, an extended Random class, as well as a [PCG Random](http://www.pcg-random.org/) implementation.

# Data structures
Fixed-size LIFO collection, discarding queue.

# Serialization helpers
Serialize things to and from binary + JSON with ease.

Rik Svendsen Rose,2016-11-24T17:38:50.543Z,23,512,"I made this project to fix the contradictory concepts behind the Repository and UnitOfWork patterns together with using inversition of control / dependancy injection. Also i wanted to make the resolving of sessions (IDbConnection) and UnitOFWork's (IDbTransaction) automatically connection / begin transaction on creation, and disconnect/commit on disposal.
Also i wanted the usage of the session and uow to become nice and simple.

Included interfaces with abstractions:

1. **IDbFactory** is a simple interface that you register with your IoC. It can create/spwan ISession's and IUntOfWork's. But primary used in code to spawn sessions.
2. **ISession>TDatabase<** extends IDbConnection. You use it to extend your Database connection / Session type. Yours session classes and interfaces require a connection string. So If you have multiple database connections, you need 1 ISession and Session extended Interface and class per database. When the session is created by the factory it connects to the database, when it disposes it discontects and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the session for any IDbConnection or dapper (or extension) framework you like, as ISession extends IDbConnection ;-). 
3. **IUnitOfWork** extends IDbTransaction. You dont need to extend anything with this. When you have created a session in you code, you can create a uow from the session. Then the session is created by the factory it begins a transaction (isolation i a parameter), when it disposes it commits (roleback on exception) and disposes. For Castle Windsor it also untracks the object. You can use the transaction for any IDbTransaction work you like as IUnitOfWork extends IDbConnection ;-).
4. **IRepository>TSession, TEntity, TPk<** is a default repository that you extend with your own repository for each of the entities you want a repository for. There as some built in methods for GetAll, Get, and SaveOrUpdate. You can add the methods you need for your entity using any IDbConnection framework. I have used [dapper-dot-net](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net) and [dapper.FastCRUD](https://github.com/MoonStorm/Dapper.FastCRUD) for the quering.
