Vladyslav Taranov,2015-10-24T05:23:38.4Z,"AqlaSerializer is intended to serialize objects, not just data. 

What the difference? Data serializers don't care much about language runtime specifics like references, inheritance, etc. In contrast, an object serializer should take such things into account.

Like protobuf-net AqlaSerializer makes possible to store objects as a small in size binary data (far smaller than xml). And it's more CPU effective than BinaryFormatter and other core .NET serializers (which could be unavailable on your target platform). Its format is designed to be: small in size - efficient data storage (far smaller than xml) cheap to process - both at the client and server platform independent - portable between different programming architectures extensible - to add new data to old messages.

AqlaSerializer project goal is not to make a Protocol Buffers compatible implementation but instead support all common .NET features. It is compatible with most of the .NET family, including .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0, Mono 2.x, Silverlight, etc. The code is heavily based on Marc Gravell's protobuf-net but there are a lot of improvements and fixes.

Implementing client side localization into any web application is always challenge. Most of web technologies provide localization using server-side technologies. For e.g. .Net application uses Resources Files(.resx) to implement localization into globalize application. 

Nowadays world is extensively moving towards Asynchronous development models like AJAX / SPA. Several frameworks, libraries are already available on the web. To access these server side resources requires custom REST services / handlers to be additionally implemented into the host application. 

This plugin makes life easier where you can manage all your localized resources into plain Text or JavaScript file. Based on current culture provided to this plugin, it loads associated resource entries for use. To enhance performance it uses Cache mechanication for subsequent Initialization calls.

What the difference? Data serializers don't care much about language runtime specifics like references, inheritance, etc. In contrast, an object serializer should take such things into account.

And it's more CPU effective than BinaryFormatter and other core .NET serializers (which could be unavailable on your target platform). Its format is designed to be: small in size - efficient data storage (far smaller than xml) cheap to process - both at the client and server platform independent - portable between different programming architectures extensible - to add new data to old messages.

AqlaSerializer project goal is not to make a Protocol Buffers compatible implementation but instead support all common .NET features. It is compatible with most of the .NET family, including .NET 2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0, Mono 2.x, Silverlight, etc. The code is heavily based on Marc Gravell's protobuf-net but there are a lot of improvements and fixes.
