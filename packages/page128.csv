When creating a site it's common for many nodes to diverge their layout from their template's Standard Values.  Since the layout field encapsulates all devices, once that link is broken it can be a real challenge to add a new device at a later date.

Out-of-the-box the only solution is to construct a new layout on the Standard Values node for the template, determine which nodes no longer use the Standard Values layout, then use the layout Copy Device functionality.

At best this is tedious and error-prone.  At worst, completely unworkable.

This module addresses this issue by firstly, identifying all the nodes that are instances of the template but are not using Standard Values. Then applying a new device layout selectively to nodes that don't use the Standard Value, without disturbing the existing layouts.

Thirdly, the platform provides a built-in security model that controls the data access.
