stop-cran,2016-07-19T19:45:38.493Z,640,640,"The package defines a custom Unity's InjectionMember - InjectionCOnstructorLookup. It resolves a provided type between several inheritors of some basis type, depending on their constructor parameter signatures.

Each inheritor should have a constructor with a certain signature - each parameter should be inherited from a type passed to InjectionCOnstructorLookup's constructor.

Here is an example. Suppose we have following types:

    interface IConfig { ... }
    interface IReport { ... }

    class ConfigA : IConfig { ... }
    class ConfigB : IConfig { ... }

    class ReportA : IReport
    {
        public ReportA (ConfigA config)
        { ... }
    }

    class ReportB : IReport
    {
        public ReportB (ConfigB config)
        { ... }
    }

The problem is - we have a IConfig as an input and we want to decide which report to create.
Suppose then, we have registered both reports:

    var unityContainer = new UnityContainer();
    
    unityContainer.RegisterType<IReport, ReportA>(""ReportA"");
    unityContainer.RegisterType<IReport, ReportB>(""ReportB"");

Do make things work we just add another registration of `IReport` with the `InjectionMember`:

    unityContainer.RegisterType<IReport>(new InjectionConstructorLookup<IConfig>());

Here `IConfig` type parameters says that we'll look for `IReport`-inherited objects with a single constructor argument, inherited from `IConfig`.

Then there are two ways of resolving `IReport`.

    var reportA = unityContainer.Resolve<IReport>(new DependencyOverride<IConfig>(new ConfigA())); // Should be ReportA
    var reportB = unityContainer.Resolve<IReport>(new DependencyOverride<IConfig>(new ConfigB())); // Should be ReportB

The second one is a delegate factory:

    var factory = unityContainer.Resolve<Func<IConfig, IReport>>();
    
    var reportA1 = factory(new ConfigA()); // Should be ReportA
    var reportB1 = factory(new ConfigB()); // Should be ReportB

Call to the factory is faster due to result caching.",UnityInjectionLookup,False,2016-07-19T19:45:38.493+00:00,True,False,Looks up a type by its constructor argument types.,"Unity,container,DI,IoC",327,False,1.0.0
