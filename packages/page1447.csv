Mamadou Samba DIALLO,2016-03-16T19:06:11.707Z,763,765,"This package can deserialize any String, Stream, or StreamReader provide by a web api response. 
Particularity is done on the HAL+JSON response. 
Installation:
On the package console run :
Install-Package HALJSonDeserializer
Usage:
After installation you must include the namespace of the package where you will use it:
using haljson;
So now: suppose that you want to call a web api via ""http://localhost:8080/customer"" in your c# code and to parse it into your custom type called ""Customer"". This can be done simply as follows:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParse<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
For async call you can do this:
 Customer theCustomer =  HALJSonDeserializer .GetAndParseAsync<Customer>(""http://localhost:8080/customer"");
If you just want to deserialize a Stream, a StreamReader or a string, their are three extrension methods for those type. You can do that as follows:
Customer  theCustomer = myStream.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a Stream
Customer  theCustomer = myStreamReader.ToObject<Customer>();  //For a StreamReader
Customer  theCustomer = myString.ToObject<Customer>(); //For a string",HALJSonDeserializer,False,2016-03-18T10:39:05.44+00:00,True,False,Parckage for deserializing HAL+JSon response datas,,2942,False,1.1.2

It is a very powerful and easy to use API that provides all basic Conversion operation for a number of file formats. API gets the file as an input and makes its Conversion accessible for the user. Now, its upto the user to perform any of his operations on this Conversion.

The product has the following key features:

- Converting document from all major file formats to all major file formats
- Native .NET API, allowing to third party developers to easy integrate GroupDocs.Conversion in their products
- Simple to use API - basically only one method with set of options for different formats.
- Abstract Storage API
- Abstract Cache API

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-03-17T08:11:21.623Z,764,764,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  


Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-03-17T08:11:15.513Z,764,764,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-03-17T08:10:53.323Z,764,764,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).

Upper Setting Corporation,2016-03-17T08:11:07.7Z,764,764,"Upper Setting's DotNetOpenServer SDK is our open source TCP client/server communication library that is lightweight, fast, secure and fully extendable enabling developers to quickly create native applications for any smart mobile device or desktop computer.  

Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).
