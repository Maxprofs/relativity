It was born out of the needs of real-world services such as Netflix, eBay, Facebook, Twitpic, etc. and is being used to run all of those services today. We've proven that it can solve some interesting problems, and it's working great in production, but it's by no means a supported product or something that you should take a hard commitment on unless you know what you're doing.

In order to know whether you qualify for using the toolkit to solve your solution, you should be looking to expose a non-relational data store (EF + WCF Data Services already solves the relational scenario) as an OData service.
