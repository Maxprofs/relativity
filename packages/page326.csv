Each test case is built up progressively from smaller pieces of data that are combined together.

The smallest pieces are referred to as 'test variables'. Each test variable is constrained to take values from its own set of allowed 'levels'.

Changing each test variable independently to a new level produces a new test case.

If a test requires a certain 'strength' of coverage of combinations of levels from different test variables, the library produces a stream of test cases that honour this guarantee while avoiding getting swamped with a combinatoric explosion of test cases.

If a parameterised test fails with an exception for a specific test case, the library creates a signature that allows it to reproduce the failing test case immediately in a separate test; this is to aid debugging.

      It's main features are:
      * The API implements the ADO.NET interfaces. If you are familiar with SqlConnection, SqlCommand, and SqlReader, you should be able to use CqlSharp with no difficulty.
      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * CqlSharp allows for partition/token aware routing of queries. This allows queries to be directly sent to the Cassandra nodes that are the 'owner' of that data.
      * Query timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * Query tracing is supported.
      * Provides an extendable logging infrastructure using MEF. Related log statements can be correlated through ""Activity GUIDs""
      * CqlSharp supports Snappy compression of queries and responses
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
      * Most behavioral aspects of the CqlSharp are configurable: max number of connections, new connection threshold, discovery scope, max connection idle time, etc. etc.
      * Relative Node Discovery: given the 'seed' nodes in your connection string, CqlSharp may find other nodes for you: all nodes in your cluster, nodes in the same data center, or the nodes in the same rack
      * Load balanced connection management: you can give your queries a load 'factor' and the client will take that into account when picking connections to send queries over.
      * Queries will be automatically retried when connections or nodes fail.
      * Node monitoring: Node failure is automatically detected. Recovery checks occur using an exponential back-off algorithm
      * CqlSharp listens to Cassandra events for node up, new node and node removed messages such that Cluster changes are automatically incorporated

**ABOUT**
Aweber offers excellent email campaign list management services and is mainly geared for capturing email addresses via its own javascript based email web forms.

Whilst this (i.e. Aweber web capture forms) is great if your requirement is directly capturing email addresses via web sites, it's not so useful if you need to subscribe and unsubscribe users directly from a back end service such as a CRM or lead management system.

Aweber do not accept (there are AUP exclusions in its T's and C's) on any form of ""automated"" subscription method that goes via its web form entry systems so it's not possible to automatically sign up users by using HTTP POST integration.

Fortunately, there is a work around using SMTP. This software is completely SMTP based and does not break any existing Aweber terms and conditions of use.
