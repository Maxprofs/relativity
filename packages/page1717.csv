BluAge Corporation,2016-07-01T09:52:53.51Z,154,658,"Summer Batch is a lightweight, reliable, efficient, open-source batch framework for .Net and C# community.  
Its design is driven by the concepts exposed in the JSR-352 specification and provides for .NET 4.5 C# an equivalent to JBatch / Spring Batch.

Key Features:
• Repeatable and customizable batch jobs
• Multi step jobs, with simple step sequences or conditional logic between them
• In-memory or persisted job repository
• Support for a Read-Process-Write logic, as well as arbitrary batchlet for a more complete control on the behavior
• Chunk processing with checkpoint management and restartability
• Step partitioning used for parallel processing
• Database readers and writers, with support for Microsoft® SQL Server, IMB® DB2 and Oracle® databases
• Flat file readers and writers
• Easy mapping between the readers and writers and your domain classes
• Batch contexts at step level and job level
• XML design for the main batch architecture, C# design for the properties

GroupDocs,2016-07-01T06:54:00.787Z,50,658,"GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET is a class library that enables you to generate documents in popular office file formats based upon template documents and 
          data obtained from various sources including databases, XML, JSON, OData, objects of custom CLR types, and more.
          
          Key features:
          
          - Support of C# syntax and LINQ extension methods directly in templates (even for ADO.NET data sources)
          
          - Support of repeatable and conditional document blocks (loops and conditions)
          
          - Support of dynamically generated charts and images
          
          - Support of multiple data sources (including of different types) for generation of a single document
          
          - Built-in support of data relations
          
          - WYSIWYG: A generated document retains the same formatting of its elements as a corresponding template has
          
          - Simple API: Generating a document is as simple as creating a DocumentAssembler instance and invoking of one of its AssembleDocument overloads
          
          Supported document formats:
          
          - Microsoft Word document formats: DOCX, DOCM, DOTX, DOTM, DOC, DOT, RTF, XML  
          
          - OpenOffice document formats: ODT, OTT
          
          - Microsoft Excel workbook formats: XLSX, XLSM, XLTX, XLTM, XLSB, XLS, XLT, XML 

          - OpenOffice spreadsheet document formats: ODS
          
          - Microsoft PowerPoint presentation formats: PPTX, PPTM, PPSX, PPSM, POTX, POTM, PPT, PPS  

          - OpenOffice presentation document formats: ODP

It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. 

At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.

            * The dump output is separated from the targeted dump media by the familiar TextWriter interface.
            * The programmer can dump the value of any type of object: primitive and  enum types (including those marked with FlagsAttribute), custom classes, struct-s, collections, etc.
            * For complex type objects (classes and structs) the dumper outputs the names and the values of the properties.
            * The dump is recursive: the complex members of the dumped object are dumped indented.
            * Dumps the elements of sequences (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
            * Handles circular references.
            * The developers can easily customize various aspects of the dump by using an attribute (DumpAttribute) on the classes and their members, such as:
                - the order in which the properties are dumped;
                - formatting of the property names and/or values;
                - suppressing the dump of some uninteresting properties;
                - masking the values of sensitive (e.g. PII) properties;
                - the depth of the recursion into complex members;
                - the maximum number of dumped elements of sequence properties.
            * The dumper picks the customization attributes also from buddy classes declared with MetadataTypeAttribute.
            * Even if the class doesn't have any attributes, the programmer can still pass a metadata class as a separate parameter to the dumping method. This allows for control over the dump of BCL and third party classes.
