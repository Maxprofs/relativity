Randolph Burt,2014-09-05T19:58:23.86Z,"TexturePacker (http://www.codeandweb.com) is a very easy to use application for creating Texture Atlases / Sprite Sheets.  The idea is that you draw the individual frames of animation for your game characters as separate image files and then drag and drop them into TexturePacker – whereupon you end up with a single image file and accompanying data file ready to load into your game.  Using a single sprite sheet is much more efficient than loading lots of individual images in game development. 

Now this maybe nothing new to a lot of people, however what you might not know, is that the latest version of TexturePacker has an option for exporting the sprite sheet and data file in a format targeted at MonoGame.  The next step is to then use this Nuget package in your MonoGame app in order to use the data files created by TexturePacker to create your animations with just a few lines of code.

      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Mono for Android

      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args))
      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
      - Supports fluent syntax
