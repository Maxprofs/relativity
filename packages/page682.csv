        *Pickles* can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients. *Gherkin* language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder. This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word
        - Excel: Microsoft Excel
        - JSON: a custom JSON format

        Optionally, *Pickles* can **integrate test results**, so that your stakeholders know which scenarios pass validation. *Pickles* supports these test formats:

        - NUnit
        - MSTest
        - XUnit

This new destination listener extension is called ReflectSoftware.Insight.Listeners.Email and allows you to send logging messages via email. This is typically done for Exceptions, Errors and Fatal messages types where you might want to be notified via email if something went wrong in your application.

Traditional simple text base logging frameworks lack what your application can easily emit in providing you better insight into the health of your application. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to easily instrument incredible rich details? Well, look no further. ReflectInsight was designed to easily let your application speak volumes!

One of ReflectInsight‚Äôs most powerful features is its impressive and elegant Viewer. The Viewer was design to hone in on particular issues and filter any unwanted noise by creating User Defined Views. User Defined Views allow you to filter a given request and visualize the execution path that actually caused the issue at hand. 

Everyone knows that debugging multithread applications is no simple task. Due to racing conditions, traditional IDE debuggers are not well suited for the job and don‚Äôt really provide an accurate picture behind the scenes. With ReflectInsight‚Äôs Live Viewer, debugging multithread applications is that much easier!

It is the robust platform for UX high-quality design solutions including of using IoC containers.
 MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. It is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations without using this pattern. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. Clear separation of concerns between View (XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and View Model characterizes a profession level and quality of the product implementation 
Digital agencies are often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development of the application. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model.
Well known Binding markup extension can bind only two properties together. The source property can be located either in Resources or either in XAML code-behind. These standard framework features don‚Äôt allow developers to separate View from View Model. The volume of code behind development dumps quality of GUI; it increases complicity and cost of maintainability. Change in View can cause the dramatic and messy changes of the code behind layer. 
For high quality UX implementation with XAML you need separate or, by other words, bind XAML by using ICommand, RouteEventHandler and other WPF handlers with View Model.",MvvmBindingPack,False,2018-01-09T00:40:10.393+00:00,True,False,Inc NetCore (Winodws 8.1 )Edition for XAML UX quality solutions.,"MVVM,XAML,WPF,WinRT,WinPhone",6315,False,1.5.6
