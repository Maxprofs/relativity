Polaris has many ready to use extensions and lambda friendly behaviors like map - reductions, comparisons, chainers, iterators and more, let you implement complex algorithms in a clear, brief but surprisingly expressive and lightning fast fashion.

Enigma simplifies the use of the most popular and recurrent cryptographic operations and algorithms like hashing with SHA256 or encrypting/decrypting with RSA15 and X509 certificates.

Some philosophy:

Extension methods and other static utility functions are not shared accross projects resp. assemblies but included wherever they are needed. For that reason they are declared ""Friend"" and namespace-less as they are supposed to be part of the project's current namespace.

Unit test files are added directly to the project and declared ""Public"" because of limitations of that framework, but they are only compiled in debug mode (through a compiler directive that checks for the ""DEBUG"" keyword). This allows to keep the tests very near to the code which simplifies access to internal members but does not bulk the published version. The reference to ""Microsoft.​VisualStudio.​TestTools.​UnitTesting"" (assembly ""Microsoft.​VisualStudio.​QualityTools.​UnitTestFramework.dll"") is only needed during development and may be declared with ""Copy Local = False"".

Extension methods and other static utility functions are not shared accross projects resp. assemblies but included wherever they are needed. For that reason they are declared ""Friend"" and namespace-less as they are supposed to be part of the project's current namespace.

Unit test files are added directly to the project and declared ""Public"" because of limitations of that framework, but they are only compiled in debug mode (through a compiler directive that checks for the ""DEBUG"" keyword). This allows to keep the tests very near to the code which simplifies access to internal members but does not bulk the published version. The reference to ""Microsoft.​VisualStudio.​TestTools.​UnitTesting"" (assembly ""Microsoft.​VisualStudio.​QualityTools.​UnitTestFramework.dll"") is only needed during development and may be declared with ""Copy Local = False"".

The NuGet package version is global across all ""Single.VB"" packages, and they always reference other packages of the same version (most recent at the time of publishing). This greatly simplifies my dependency handling and therefore improves the quality of the NuGet packages, but may leed to an updated package that does not contain any code change. I apologize for that inconvenience.
