Библиотека содержит встроенные словари глаголов, существительных, прилагательных и местоимений русского языка на основе небезызвестного словаря Зализняка.




Реализован следующий функционал:

•Точный и эвристический поиск основной формы существительных, глаголов, прилагательных в словаре.
•Определение рода и одушевленности существительного, вида глагола (совершенный, несовершенный), валентности глагола(переходный, непереходный), разряд прилагательного (качественные, относительные).
•Склонение существительных по падежам.
•Спряжение глаголов по лицам, числу, времени, родам. Генерация активного и пассивного залогов.
•Генерация указательных форм глагола, спряжение их по числу и залогу.
•Генерация причастий из глаголов. Склонение их по залогам, падежам, родам, числу и времени. Генерация краткой формы причастия.
•Генерация деепричастий из глаголов. Спряжение их по времени.
•Склонение прилагательных по падежам. Генерация краткой формы прилагательного. Генерация сравнительной степени прилагательного. 
•Генерация сравнительных степеней наречий.
•Генерация личных, притяжательных, возвратных и притяжательно-возвратных местоимений. Склонение их по падежам, лицам, родам, числу.
•Стеммер.
