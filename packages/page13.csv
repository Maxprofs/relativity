There are 3 layers of security to prevent abuse. 

1. The API signs the remote url with HMAC SHA-256 to prevent anyone from tampering or generating them without access to the signing key.
2. A whitelist approach is taken to sites. By default, no sites are allowed. You must handle the RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.AllowRemoteRequest event to permit sites (or portions of sites) to be relayed.
4. The  plugin requires that all remote images be decoded and re-encoded. Files are never returned as-is. This ensures that the files are valid images, and prevents XSS attacks.

Please note, you must configure the <remotereader signingKey=""to a long and secure pass phrase"" /> and set <remotereader allowAllSignedRequests=""true"" /> if all code calling RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.CreateSignedUrl(remoteUrl,settings) is trusted.

Selenium Committers,2011-08-23T18:43:09.667Z,"Selenium is a set of different software tools each with a different approach to supporting browser automation. These tools are highly flexible, allowing many options for locating and manipulating elements within a browser, and one of its key features is the support for automating multiple browser platforms. This package contains the .NET bindings for the older, more procedural Selenium Remote Control (or Selenium RC) API, but implemented using the newer WebDriver technology. It does not require a running instance of the Selenium Server, and is not limited to the functionality available from within the JavaScript sandbox. It is intended as a transitional package to allow organizations with significant investment in the Selenium RC API to run their code with minimal modifications until they are able to migrate to the newer Selenium WebDriver API.",Selenium.WebDriverBackedSelenium,False,2018-04-12T15:57:17.07+00:00,True,"Implementation of the Selenium Remote Control (RC) API, using WebDriver technology","Selenium,WebDriver,remote,control,RC,browser,automation",543248,False,2.5.0
