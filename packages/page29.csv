Francois Vanderseypen,2011-12-07T07:16:38.803Z,"Processing.js is the sister project of the popular visual programming language Processing, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language (or JavaScript), include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest.

Processing.js is perhaps best thought of as a JavaScript runtime for the Processing language. Where Processing relies upon Java for its graphics back-end, Processing.js uses the web--HTML5, canvas, and WebGL--to create 2D and 3D graphics, without developers having to learn those APIs and technologies.

Originally developed by Ben Fry and Casey Reas, Processing started as an open source programming language based on Java to help the electronic arts and visual design communities learn the basics of computer programming in a visual context. Processing.js takes this to the next level, allowing Processing code to be run by any HTML5 compatible browser, including current versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.

Much like the native language, Processing.js is a community driven project, and continues to grow as browser technology advances. Processing.js is now compatible with Processing, and has an active developer and user community.",Processing.js,False,2011-12-06T23:16:38.82-08:00,True,False,"Processing.js is the sister project of the popular Processing visual programming language, designed for the web.","data,visualization,processing",1789,False,1.3.6

There are 3 layers of security to prevent abuse. 

1. The API signs the remote url with HMAC SHA-256 to prevent anyone from tampering or generating them without access to the signing key.
2. A whitelist approach is taken to sites. By default, no sites are allowed. You must handle the RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.AllowRemoteRequest event to permit sites (or portions of sites) to be relayed.
4. The  plugin requires that all remote images be decoded and re-encoded. Files are never returned as-is. This ensures that the files are valid images, and prevents XSS attacks.

Please note, you must configure the <remotereader signingKey=""to a long and secure pass phrase"" /> and set <remotereader allowAllSignedRequests=""true"" /> if all code calling RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.CreateSignedUrl(remoteUrl,settings) is trusted.
