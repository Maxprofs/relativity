		Features include:
		* Log counts, timings, gauges, sets, calendargrams and raw metrics
		* Has an additional API that uses dynamics to create and submit stats
		* Fault-tolerant client that can be configured to fail silently (with a warning) if misconfigured
		* IStatsdClient interface for easy mocking in unit tests
		* Allows for customisation of every output stat to do things like screen metrics before sending
		* Supports a user-defined prefix to prepend to every metric		
    * Outputs to UDP or TCP 

    .Net 4.0 and 4.5 Users:
    * Use the StatsdExtensions to define metrics without having to manipulate strings
    * The dynamic stats builder interface provides a cleaner alternative to creating and logging metrics

      Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a cross-platform MVVM development framework built on top of:
      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Mono for Android
      - WinRT XAML framework for Windows 8 Store apps
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.
      The core of toolkit contains a navigation system, windows management system, IocContainer, validation, etc.
      The Mugen MVVM Toolkit provides a powerful bindings that you can use on any platform, here are some features:
      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args))
      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
      - Special editor for WinForms, you do not need to write code to create bindings
      - Supports fluent syntax
      - Excellent performance",MugenMvvmToolkit.Android.API17,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,,"mugen,mvvm,toolkit,binding,wpf,winforms,android,windows,phone,winrt,cross,platform",-1,False,1.0.11

      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))

      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.

The HTML to PDF Converter can convert to PDF any HTML document or URL that a modern browser can display, preserving all the CSS styles and executing all the JavaScript scripts found in the HTML document.

Besides the common features a HTML to PDF Converter must have, the HiQPdf component has some unique features on the market like the support for web fonts in Web Open Font Format (WOFF), the ability to convert only a selected region of the HTML document or the possibility to overlap multiple HTML documents in the same PDF while preserving the transparent backgrounds and images from the HTML document.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents with last generation content like Scalar Vector Graphics, Canvas and CSS3 styles. The JavaScript engine is fast, can handle complex scripts and exposes in HTML page objects you can use to manually trigger conversion or to determine various information about converter during conversion.

The HiQPdf HTML to PDF Converter can render HTML documents using Web Fonts in formats like Web Open Font Format (WOFF), TrueType or OpenType with TrueType Outlines. The Web Fonts offer a great flexibility to web designers to create special effects on text in a HTML document because they are not limited anymore to a small set of fonts installed on the client computers displaying the HTML document.",hiqpdf,False,2017-08-19T11:55:58.87+00:00,True,False,"The HiQPdf Library for .NET offers you a modern, simple, fast, flexible and powerful tool to create complex and stylish PDF documents in your applications with just a few lines of code.","HTML,to,PDF,Converter",106501,False,8.3.0

      - WinForms
      - WPF
      - Silverlight 5
      - Silverlight for WP7.1, WP8, WP8.1
      - Mono for Android

      - All of the features available for WPF platform available on all platforms and even more
      - Binding supports C# language expressions like Linq, Extension methods, method call, etc. example: (Text Items.Where(x => x == Name)), (Text $string.Format('{0} {1}', Prop1, Prop2))
      - Supports subscription to any control event. (TextChanged ViewModelMethod($args))
      - Built-in support for validation example: (Text Prop1, Validate=True), (Text $GetErrors(Prop1).FirstOrDefault())
      - You can easily write their own extensions for bindings, example: (Text $i18.MyLocalizableString), (Text $MyCustomMethod(Prop1))
      - Supports attached members (properties, events, methods), you can extend any object as you want.
