      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.
