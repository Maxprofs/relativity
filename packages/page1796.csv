      IMPORTANT: The Serpent cipher as of 1.8.0 is incompatible with the behaviour of Serpent in earlier releases; it has been modified to conform to the standard byte-order interpretation for blocks (and keys). The previous behaviour is available from 1.8.0 as the ""Tnepres"" cipher. See BMA-52 for more information if this may affect you.

Wintellect - Jeffrey Richter,2011-09-04T07:20:03.903Z,2188,2420,"Wintellect's own Jeffrey Richter has produced the Power Threading library (DLL) containing many classes to help with threading and asynchronous programming. 

There are versions of the library for the .NET Framework, Silverlight, and the .NET Compact Framework.

Jeffrey has described many of the classes contained in the library by way of his MSDN Magazine Concurrent Affairs columns. 

The library also contains some non-threading related classes for working with exceptions, command-line parsing, and more. 

When you download it, please read the enclosed End User License Agreement (EULA) before using the library in your own projects.
