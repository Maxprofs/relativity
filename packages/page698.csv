UFO automatically performs mapping by combining the names of the class properties of the entity with the names of the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures.

- Bidirectional Mapping: UFO accepts entity objects as source parameters for SQL queries and stored procedures. The results of SQL queries / stored procedures are also returned as such entity objects.

- No SQL generator: Writing the SQL / Stored Procedures code by yourself. The code generated by the ORM engines invariably turns out to be slow and complicated.

- Lack of nested types and ""lazy loading"": ... and other gadgets slowing down the process ... Sorry. Only pure and fast mapping!

- POCO Entities: using ""pure"" classes of entities with no special attributes, additional mapping files or any other additions that obscure the code.

- Extremely fast: UFO reads the entity class structure and the parameters of SQL queries / stored procedures only once, and then moves them to the FAST cache.

- MS SQL Server: UFO supports the Microsoft SQL Server by default, but thanks to its modular design, you can enter your own provider for another database.

- Insert / Update: Support for fast insert and update of large amounts of data.

- Multiple formats for the transmission of input parameters: 1) Entity objects as the source of parameters (bidirectional mapping) for SQL queries and stored procedures. 2) Numbered parameters for SQL queries. 3) Ordered parameters for stored procedures.

The goal is to have an easy-to-use and uniform yet modular and pluggable facility to handle common cross-cutting concerns in my applications, thereby freeing me up to focus on the actual application concerns and hopefully making it easier and faster to build them.
      In general, the library consists of interfaces or SPIs along with ways to access them (using MEF). One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.
      For more detailed information and documentation, please visit the GitHub page for this repository at http://aashishkoirala.github.io/commons. You can find more of my stuff by visiting my page at http://aashishkoirala.github.io.

This package contains builds of the NUnitLite runner for .NET 2.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 as well as Silverlight 5.0.


How to use this package:


1. Create a console application for your tests and delete the generated class containing Main().

2. Install the NUnitLite package, which creates a new Main() as well as adding a reference to NUnitLite. This will also bring in the NUnit package, which adds a reference to the nunit framework to your project.

3.
