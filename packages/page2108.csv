This library provides classes and functions designed and implemented following as strictly as possible the GLSL conventions and functionalities so that when a programmer knows GLSL, he knows GLM as well, making it really easy to use. 
This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, half-based types, random number generation, procedural noise functions, etc. 
GLM ensures interoperability with third party libraries, SDKs and OpenGL; replacing advantageously the deprecated matrix functions. It is a good candidate for software rendering (Raytracing / Rasterisation), image processing, physic simulations and any context that requires a simple and convenient mathematics library. 

It is a platform independent library with no dependence to external libraries even OpenGL. GLM is written in C++98 but can take advantage of C++11 when available. It supports the following compilers:
Clang 2.6 and higher 
CUDA 3.0 and higher 
GCC 3.4 and higher 
Intel C++ Composer XE 2013 and higher 
LLVM 2.3 through GCC 4.2 front-end and higher 
Visual C++ 2005 and higher 
Any conform C++98 or C++11 compiler
