theeg,2013-12-11T18:30:12.267Z,"DependencyAnalysis is a software testing tool for architectural constraints.

Who are you?

 You are a software developer. You feel a special interest in test driven development, clean code and software architecture.

What do you want?


 What you can see in your every day work, is the code quality level of classes in your IDE. Automated tests can be accessed, approved and extended right away.
 There are hurdles when surveying the software at the architectural level. It requires a tool first. There are quite some available. Now you have chosen for example CoolArchitecture2000 as the weapon of choice. It has a lot of features. But it has a drawback. Anytime you want to check something has changed to the architecture, you have to start that tool.

What is wrong?

We developers are the Montgomery Scotts of our software project. Our place is the machine deck (the IDE). If we had to use the turbolifts to the bridge several times a day to see the results of our work, how long will this process last until we skip the bridge visit? 

Who do you think is responsible for keeping a software architecture in shape?

1. The software architect?
 Well the architect designs dependencies, has an overview of the whole project and bears a vision of the future structure. He suggests technologies to use. Often, he is not the one, who makes daily commits and actively changes the projects structure.

2.Can a dedicated developer be the guardian of architecture?
 This will work for a prolonged time. Once he goes on holiday, no one else will invest the effort required to perform the task of keeping everything in shape. His team mates are not familiar with this task.

3. The answer must be every developer of the team is responsible.
 More or less each team member has an insight at the meta-level of the project he is contributing. This is the source where the check-ins come from. And this is the only instance that can actually influence a growing sofware project.",EggAndGherkin,False,2014-09-29T07:07:14.42-07:00,True,False,DependencyAnalysis is a development tool to qualify the evolvement of your software architecture within predefined limits.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha generation algorithms makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically. This approach to Captcha security is validated by the BotDetect track record: we have over 2500 paying customers and not one confirmed case of automated Captcha breaking by spammers.
    
BotDetect provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep ASP.NET web applications accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem, enabling you to make WCAG and Section 508 compliant websites.

Features
  * 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
  * 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
  * Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
  * Custom Captcha image size, format, color scheme...
  * Custom Captcha code length, style, character set, timeouts, generated code filtering...
  * Many other randomization & customization options
  * Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict, Section 508 and WCAG AAA compliant markup
  * Visual Studio .NET 2013, 2012, 2010, 2008, 2005 and 2003 Designer support
  * Medium trust environment support for shared servers
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET WebForms and ASP.NET MVC applications
  * Fully compatible with ASP.NET Ajax and jQuery Ajax validation

      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
