Clockwork is a complete programming paradigm that lets you model and execute complex business processes. In Clockwork you write Gears that encapsulate specific business steps. Then you write code to assemble Gears together to compose complete business processes called Mechanisms. A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so that you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching existing Mechanisms and Gears you have already in your library.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.

This is a 30 day evaluation version, which later can be unlocked. No registration required.

As part of a .NET application, ChemBytes Draw on demand displays a fully featured chemical drawing editor, which also supports organometallic, polymer and peptide drawing. Content can be imported from other third party chemical drawing tools, e.g. ISIS/Symyx/Accelrys Draw, ChemDraw, Marvin, etc., via MDL clipboard content or via MDL format export files, including V3000 format. When the user closes the editor, the API takes over and exposes the chemical information for use by your own application. Thus, the molecular weights and elemental formulas of all entered reactants and products, their InChIKeys, bitmap and vector images, bounding boxes, the MDL reaction and molfiles, and the internal file format for database storage, etc. are available for further processing. ChemBytes Draw is written in 100% managed code, i.e. it is no wrapper around an existing Java or C++ functionality.
