Sounds simple, but can become a very complicated and repetitive task.

So I, with the help of some comrades of development, have created a way to automate this in a very generic way.

Before using this, some observations;

This code is highly experimental and has no guarantee that works perfectly in all cases.
It was developed on top of NHibernate, but could works with another ORM tool3 - .
