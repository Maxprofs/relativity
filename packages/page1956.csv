-Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of QuickBooks API calls.

-Retry policy constructors to help apps handle transient errors.

-Logging mechanisms for trace, request/response, and Azure logging.

-Sync APIs that assist with data synchronization between QuickBooks Desktop and Intuit's cloud.

-Query Filters that enable you to write LINQ queries to retrieve QuickBooks entities whose properties meet specified criteria.

-LINQ queries for accessing QuickBooks Reports.

-Sparse Update to update writable properties specified in a request and leave the others unchanged.
