The world file contains the geospatial information pertaining to the image.

World files are small text files with an extension that matches the original image's extension, but with the middle character of the extension changed to a ""w"".

The RegexStyle allows you to use complex regular expression matching to determine how your features are drawn. A regular expression is a matching syntax that allows you to match a string based on very complex criteria. For example, let's say you have a layer that has a column in the data that contains school names. Most school names include the type of school they are. For instance, you may have ""Lincoln Middle School"" or ""Bush High School."" There are variations to these names though, containing words such as ""Elementary"" or ""Prep."" With a regular expression, you can create matching criteria that will allow you to match on many variations of the names. It is especially useful for fuzzy matches where your data is not clearly categorized. Another classic example is for matching or validating email addresses, where matching rules can become complex. In the RegexStyle, you specify the matching criteria string and also the style you want to use to draw the feature if the criteria matches. It is a simple yet powerful style for dealing with complex rule sets and imprecise data.

Alex Solovyov / Ivars Sudmalis,2017-06-09T10:29:38.03Z,59,315,"DBreeze database key features:
        
- Embedded .NET family assembly, platform independent and without references to other libraries. 
- Multi-threaded, ACID compliant, with a solution for deadlocks resolving/elimination, parallel reads and synchronized writes/reads. 
- No fixed scheme for table names (construction and access on the fly).
- Tables can reside in mixed locations: different folders, hard drives, memory.
- Liana-Trie indexing technology. Database indexes (keys) never need to be defragmented. Speed of insert/update/remove operations doesn't change during the time.
- Ability to access Key/Value pair of a table by physical link, what can economize time for joining necessary data structures.
- No limits for database size (except ""long"" size for each table and physical resources constraints).
- Low memory and physical space consumption, also while random inserts and updates. Updates reside the same physical space, if possible.
- High performance of CRUD operations. When you need, unleash DBreeze power and get 500000 key/value pairs insert or 260K updates per second per core into sorted table on the hard drive of standard PC.
- High speed of random keys batch insert and updates (batch must be sorted in memory ascending and non-overwrite flag must be set).
- Range selects / Traversing (Forward, Backward, From/To, Skip, StartsWith etc). Remove keys, change keys.
- Keys and values, on the low level, are always byte arrays. 
- Max. key size is 65KB, max. value size is 2GB. Value can be represented as a set of columns, where can be stored data types of fixed or dynamic length. Every dynamic datablock can be of size 2GB. 
- Rich set of conversion functions from/to between byte[] and other data types.
- Nested / Fractal tables which can reside inside of master tables values.
- Incremental backup/restore option.
- Integrated text-search subsystem (full-text/partial).
- Integrated object database layer.
- Fast multi-parameter search subsystem with powerful query possibilities.
- DBreeze is a foundation for complex data storage solutions (graph/neuro, object, document, text search etc. data layers). Please, study documentation to understand all abilities of DBreeze.

The RegexStyle allows you to use complex regular expression matching to determine how your features are drawn. A regular expression is a matching syntax that allows you to match a string based on very complex criteria. For example, let's say you have a layer that has a column in the data that contains school names. Most school names include the type of school they are. For instance, you may have ""Lincoln Middle School"" or ""Bush High School."" There are variations to these names though, containing words such as ""Elementary"" or ""Prep."" With a regular expression, you can create matching criteria that will allow you to match on many variations of the names. It is especially useful for fuzzy matches where your data is not clearly categorized. Another classic example is for matching or validating email addresses, where matching rules can become complex. In the RegexStyle, you specify the matching criteria string and also the style you want to use to draw the feature if the criteria matches. It is a simple yet powerful style for dealing with complex rule sets and imprecise data.

The ValueStyle allows you to match data in the FeatureSource against a value string. If the value matches, then we will use the style defined in that item to do the drawing. For example, let's say you have some data that contains states, and each state is categorized as either a high, medium or low pollution state. Based on the string values of ""High"", Medium"" and ""Low"", we can match on these. If a feature's data for the column matched the string ""High"", then we would use the high ValueItem's styles to draw that feature. This can be applied to all kinds of things such as road classification and more.

The shapefile format is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system (GIS) software. It is developed and regulated by ESRI as a (mostly) open specification for data interoperability among ESRI and other GIS software products. The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.

The world file contains the geospatial information pertaining to the image. Using the world file, we know its spatial position and other required information to draw it on the map relative to other images or spatial features. World files are small text files with an extension that matches the original image's extension, but with the middle character of the extension changed to a ""w"". If you have images that you want to use but do not have their world files, please contact the source of the image so that they can provide one for you. world files are fairly common in the GIS community.
