It allows the packaging of a program unit that performs a mathematical function into a 'module', which has strongly defined and typed inputs and outputs. The outputs of modules can then be linked to the inputs of other modules to form a directed graph (known as a 'module graph') which defines the workflow. The hierarchy implicit in the module graph allows the workflow to be executed automatically in order of dependency when processed. Workflows can also be serialized to and from XML documents, and hence written to and read from persistent storage (file, database, network, etc...).

Picoe Software Solutions Inc.,2016-10-07T23:19:02.04Z,58,560,"Eto.Forms is a cross platform desktop user interface framework.

This framework is built so that you can target multiple platforms with one UI codebase.

The goal of this framework is to expose a common API that can be used to build functional applications that run across platforms using their native toolkit. This will make your applications look and work as if it were a native application on all platforms.

For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.

In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or more) of the following packages:

- Eto.Platform.Wpf
- Eto.Platform.Windows
- Eto.Platform.Direct2D
- Eto.Platform.Gtk
- Eto.Platform.Gtk3
- Eto.Platform.Mac
- Eto.Platform.XamMac  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.
- Eto.Platform.XamMac2  * requires Xamarin Studio on OS X.
