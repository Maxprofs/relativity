This library is capable of generating and verifying both TOTP and HOTP authentication codes.  The calculations in this library are known to be compatible with Google 2-Step Verification and consequently the Google Authenticator smartphone app.  It is also known to be able to generate codes for Amazon Web Services Multi Factor Authentication and Dropbox 2 step authentication.  It should work with any other service or client that is RFC compliant.

This library is released under an MIT license. No warranty is provided as to the correctness of the library and the consumer of the library assumes all risk for the use thereof, as per the MIT license.

Every effort has gone into implementing this library in accordance with the RFCs mentioned above. However it is up to the users of this library to read through the RFCs and ensure that this implementation is in accordance with the security procedures outlined therein.

The implementation includes the code calculation as well as simple verification. Persistence of the keys, secure key storage, ensuring that a single code can't be validated multiple times and other things are not a part of this library.

It includes the MongoDB and SQL Server output cache providers extending ASP.NET Output Cache capabilities by allowing to store cached data outside of the application process that is especially important in web-farm scenario.

This library provides ""Session-On-Demand"" functionality - ability to separate ASP.NET Session data to subsets that can be stored outside of the main ASP.NET session and loaded on demand when it's really used rather on every request. This optimizes the out-of-proc ASP.NET session management and increases the overall site performance. These subsets of data can also be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

As an additional functionality, the library provides ""Cache-On-Demand"" that functions as an external out-of-process cache shared by all servers on web-farm. This cached data can be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

All functionality is highly configurable and extendable.

The FlexiCache 1.1 has ability automatically collect meta data (metatags) for each cached resource or accept custom meta tags. This provides further functionality to remove the cached data by using application meaningful information embedded in the metatags. The removal process is based on application business logic.
