      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.

Radiator is a small framework that provides functionlity to execute and validate commands. The point of the framework is to work in conjuction with the CQRS (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) methodology. This framework does not provide Event Sourcing or Querying. This framework is purely for command execution and validation. This framework was first built to be used with MVC web projects, however it could be used in any kind of project and there is no reference or dependance on MVC.


How to use it?

Radiator is a small framework that provides functionlity to execute and validate commands. The point of the framework is to work in conjuction with the CQRS (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) methodology. This framework does not provide Event Sourcing or Querying. This framework is purely for command execution and validation. This framework was first built to be used with MVC web projects, however it could be used in any kind of project and there is no reference or dependance on MVC.


How to use it?
