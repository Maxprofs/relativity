Traditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that ""aren't there"", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. 

- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.
- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his ""billion-dollar mistake.""
- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.

All this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?

GitHub is here: https://github.com/anagram4wander/VirtualizingObservableCollection

So, what to do about it? We made one ourselves – the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.
◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
◾Has a data access performance curve so good it’s just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.

jsTree functions properly in either box-model (content-box or border-box), can be loaded as an AMD module, and has a built in mobile theme for responsive design, that can easily be customized. It uses jQuery's event system, so binding callbacks on various events in the tree is familiar and easy.

 * drag & drop support
 * keyboard navigation
 * inline edit, create and delete
