James Jensen,2015-02-07T04:44:07.683Z,"Provides a class and a few extension methods to facilitate common operations with values that may or may not exist.

Traditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that ""aren't there"", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. 

- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.
- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his ""billion-dollar mistake.""
- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.

All this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?

Well, that's where `Maybe<>` comes in.",CallMeMaybe,False,2017-10-11T04:16:35.657+00:00,True,False,A C# library to help you deal with optional values.,"maybe,monad,option,optional,linqpad-samples",5918,False,0.5.0

http://alphachitech.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/virtualizing-observable-collection/

GitHub is here: https://github.com/anagram4wander/VirtualizingObservableCollection

So, what to do about it? We made one ourselves – the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.
◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
◾Has a data access performance curve so good it’s just as fast as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.
◾Works in any .NET project because it’s implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",VirtualizingObservableCollection,False,2015-03-31T11:43:02.803-07:00,True,False,PCL Implementation of a VirtualizingObservableCollection that implements full editing and is highly performing.,"mvvm,wpf,windowsstore,win8,windowsphone,windowsphone8,xamarin,xaramin.forms,virtualization",8040,False,0.9.0

jsTree is easily extendable, themable and configurable, it supports HTML & JSON data sources, AJAX & async callback loading.

jsTree functions properly in either box-model (content-box or border-box), can be loaded as an AMD module, and has a built in mobile theme for responsive design, that can easily be customized. It uses jQuery's event system, so binding callbacks on various events in the tree is familiar and easy.

You also get:
 * drag & drop support
 * keyboard navigation
 * inline edit, create and delete
 * tri-state checkboxes
 * fuzzy searching
 * customizable node types
