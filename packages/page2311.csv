ThinkGeo,2017-03-07T06:28:00.783Z,313,409,"ThinkGeo.MapSuite.Styles.Regex is a style extension to the Map Suite product line, see below for compatibility.  The RegexStyle allows you to use complex regular expression matching to determine how your features are drawn. A regular expression is a matching syntax that allows you to match a string based on very complex criteria. For example, let's say you have a layer that has a column in the data that contains school names. Most school names include the type of school they are. For instance, you may have ""Lincoln Middle School"" or ""Bush High School."" There are variations to these names though, containing words such as ""Elementary"" or ""Prep."" With a regular expression, you can create matching criteria that will allow you to match on many variations of the names. It is especially useful for fuzzy matches where your data is not clearly categorized. Another classic example is for matching or validating email addresses, where matching rules can become complex. In the RegexStyle, you specify the matching criteria string and also the style you want to use to draw the feature if the criteria matches. It is a simple yet powerful style for dealing with complex rule sets and imprecise data.

Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design.  CAD software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting, or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects.  CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional space.  

** This is an extension for use in ThinkGeo's Map Suite product line, see below,  as it cannot be used stand alone. **

For example, let's say you have some data that contains states, and each state is categorized as either a high, medium or low pollution state. Based on the string values of ""High"", Medium"" and ""Low"", we can match on these. If a feature's data for the column matched the string ""High"", then we would use the high ValueItem's styles to draw that feature. This can be applied to all kinds of things such as road classification and more.

The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI.

It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a rich declaration and type information model.
