So long as you are comfortable using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor syntax - you're already most of the way there!

Inpired by the likes of Jekyll and Octopress - and greatly helped along the way by the scripts behind @tomaspetricek's personal website; FsBlog gives the average .NET or Mono dev the tools that they need to get a statically built website up and running quickly and hosted somewhere like Github Pages.

This set of tools have been pulled together using some of the following community projects:

    FAKE for automation and scripting of the different tasks.
    F# Formatting for Markdown and F# literate programming, processing and colorization.
    RazorEngine which is used for the templating and embedded C# code.

James Jensen,2014-03-07T15:39:46.767Z,"Provides a class and a few extension methods to facilitate common operations with values that may or may not exist.

Traditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that ""aren't there"", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. 

- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.
- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his ""billion-dollar mistake.""
- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.

All this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?
