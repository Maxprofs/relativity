      BUGS
      - ObservableCollection is not supported for now, Please use IList on your property and set it in constructor as ObservableCollection. You can find that in sample project.




      Just Inherit from SavableObject and use Save() Load() Methods to save and load your data. You can keep your SavableObject as a Static variable or Property to reach from anywhere of your application.

      You can review the sample project from this link:

=========

gstreamer-sharp is a .NET/mono binding for Gstreamer
generated from gobject-introspection data using the [bindinator].
gstreamer-sharp currently wraps the API exposed by Gstreamer 1.12
and is compatible with newer gstreamer versions. It was developed
under GSoC 2014 for the mono organization. gstreamer-sharp covers
the core and base gstreamer libraries.

Prerequisites
----
These libraries are needed for clutter-sharp to compile:
* gstreamer core, base and good 1.14 or higher
* [gtk-sharp] 3.22.6 or higher - *NOTE: This can be built as a meson subproject if using the meson build system.*

You will also need various .NET/mono bits (mcs and al). On debian-based distros
you can install these with:

    sudo apt-get install mono-mcs mono-devel

Building & Installing
----

    meson build && ninja -C build/

HACKING
-------

While hacking on the code generator or the `.metadata` files, you will
need to force code regeneration with `ninja update-code`, a full rebuild
is triggered right after.

Updating to new GStreamer version
--------------------------------

* Make sure [bindinator] is installed on the system

Make sure you are in an environement where latest `.gir` files are available (either install
or through the `$GI_TYPELIB_PATH` env var).

    ninja -C update-all

* Verify newly generated code and `git add` files in `sources/generated/` and `ges/generated`
* Commit

Supported Platforms
----
* Linux
* Mac OS X

Quick Start
----
gstreamer-sharp provides ports of all samples from gst-docs in the samples folder.

Documentation
----

Since this is a gobject-introspection binding the recommended documentation is
the native [gstreamer] documentation. A monodoc generated documentation will be installed.

Roadmap
----
* Add an easy way to compile on Windows
* iOS and Android support
* Provide binaries for these platforms
