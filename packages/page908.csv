LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core, with near-linear scalability for multi-threaded applications. It also features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
