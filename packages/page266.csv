It can also be used to send and receive MMS using MM1 protocol, and SMS using SMPP protocol.

Some of the features of the library

* Send SMS
* Read incoming SMS
* Send MMS
* Read MMS
* Send WAP Push message
* Send vCalendar, vCard
* Send Flash SMS
* Send Picture SMS
* Send OTA bitmap, ringtone, operator logo, or custom Smart SMS
* Send QR Code or any other kinds of barcodes like EAN-8 or EAN-13
* Send and receive Class 1, Class 2, Class 3 7 bit ANSI, 8 bit-ANSI, or 16-bit Unicode messages
* Send QRCode as Picture SMS
* Send QRCode through MMS
* Flexibility to set content as string or byte array for binary SMS
* Read and set various information on the phones. E.g. SMSC, battery level, network parameters
* Read and delete messages from the phones
* Dial, answer and hang up call
* Detect incoming call, and automatically hang up the call
* Support USSD
* Read and write to phone book
* Export SMS from phone/GSM modem
* Export phone book
* Built-in multiple gateways suport, which means you can use more than 1 GSM modems at one time, and the messages are routed and load balanced among all the gateways
* Basic routing and load balancing (round robin) are built-in, and you can define your own routing and load balancing rules by overriding the default class
* Ability to define group of destination numbers so that messages can be sent in bulk easily
* Ability to detect gateway disconnection and route message to active gateway
* Delayed message sending
* Run-time debug mode
* Persisted queue
