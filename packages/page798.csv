Imagine if you could write code and you never had to compile a single change you do. You just ran the app and coded all along. Well, you can stop imagining, because that is a reality.

ShapeFX its just that! It's productivity, period. Write your objects a single time and never more you have to worry about compiling them, we'll take care of that for you. But we're much more than that. As we deploy as source we are the fastest way you'll ever know to correct a bug in production. Just pull the source via FTP, change, save and you´re done. We are also the only way to make critical changes into deployed components without restarts.

Works in a future-proof way. Connect your objects to a remote source code repo and sync them with the latest version of the code you want executed. If you´re not impressed until here, see for yourself, try the beta and we are sure that next time you´ll remember how many times you compiled your code.

AD allows exact and efficient calculation of derivatives, by systematically applying the chain rule of calculus at the elementary operator level. AD is different from numerical differentiation, which is prone to truncation and round-off errors, and symbolic differentiation, which is exact but not efficient for run-time calculations and can only handle closed-form mathematical expressions.

Using the DiffSharp library, derivative calculations (gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, directional derivatives, and matrix-free Hessian- and Jacobian-vector products) can be incorporated with minimal change into existing algorithms. Please see the API Overview page for a list of available operations.
