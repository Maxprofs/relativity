Knockout MVC is a library for ASP.NET MVC3/MVC4 , that is a wrapper for Knockout.js, that helps to move entire business logic to the server side: the complete JavaScript code necessary on the client side will be generated automatically based on the described C# (or VB.NET) model. Binding of the page interface to business model is done MVVM-style with the help of C#/VB.NET expressions (not separate properties, but expressions over them that will be translated to JavaScript code) using IntelliSense. If complex operations should be done to the model, it is possible to address to any model method on the server using one short string (ajax query will be automatically generated; and when the client will get the updated model, the whole interface will automatically refresh).
