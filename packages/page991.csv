      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
      - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
      - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues
      - ObjectToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int32ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int16ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int64ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - SingleToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - DoubleToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - FormatStringConverter
      - Int16OffsetConverter
      - Int32OffsetConverter
      - Int64OffsetConverter
      - SingleOffsetConverter
      - DoubleOffsetConverter
      - ThicknessConverter

      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      + XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo
      - many more...

      So stay tuned for updates!

      Blue.MVVM is, and will remain, an ultra lightweight suite supporting your Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) based applications.


      _about this package_

      This package includes highly configurable converters.
      Included converters in this package so far:
      - BoolToVisibilityConverter: With configurable Visbilities for True/False input values
      - MultiplyDoubleConverter: configurable standard factor, additional (optional) factor vie ConvererParameter, (optional) Min- and MaxValues
      - ObjectToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int32ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int16ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - Int64ToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - SingleToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - DoubleToVisibilityConverter -> using strategy-pattern to allow various configurations
      - FormatStringConverter
      - Int16OffsetConverter
      - Int32OffsetConverter
      - Int64OffsetConverter
      - SingleOffsetConverter
      - DoubleOffsetConverter
      - ThicknessConverter

      The package currently integrates a resource-dictionary, demonstrating the intended usage of the converters. Feel free to delete this file when you familiarized with the usage. However, don´t extend this file, as this may be updated in future releases, until the corresponding ""sample"" pacakge is available


      _what to expect in future releases?_

      There are many ideas around regarding upcoming releases of the Blue.MVVM suite.
      However, those updates will be shipped in form of additional packages. This way, you can add just those packages that best fits your application and needs.

      Upcoming releases may include, but are not limited to:
      + XML-comments
      - packages with samples
      - (fluid)validation
      - message broker
      - IoC-Container integration
      - public git-repo
      - many more...

      So stay tuned for updates!
