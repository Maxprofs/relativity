Tom Pallister,2018-04-17T18:31:50.78Z,2,3,This project is aimed at people using .NET running a micro services / service orientated architecture that need a unified point of entry into their system. In particular I want easy integration with IdentityServer reference and bearer tokens. We have been unable to find this in my current workplace without having to write our own Javascript middlewares to handle the IdentityServer reference tokens. We would rather use the IdentityServer code that already exists to do this. Ocelot is a bunch of middlewares in a specific order. Ocelot manipulates the HttpRequest object into a state specified by its configuration until it reaches a request builder middleware where it creates a HttpRequestMessage object which is used to make a request to a downstream service. The middleware that makes the request is the last thing in the Ocelot pipeline. It does not call the next middleware. The response from the downstream service is stored in a per request scoped repository and retrived as the requests goes back up the Ocelot pipeline. There is a piece of middleware that maps the HttpResponseMessage onto the HttpResponse object and that is returned to the client. That is basically it with a bunch of other features.,Ocelot,True,2018-04-18T19:42:30.527+00:00,True,False,,"API,Gateway,.NET,core",26760,False,5.6.0-unstable0005

* Exception Handlinfg
  * ThrowAll (produce AggregateException when waiting on Task.WhenAll)
  * Format (format async exception into friendlier callstack represantation)
* Timeout (will apply timeout semantic for any Task)
  * WithTimeout (will throw on timeout)
  * IsTimeoutAsync (will return indication without throwing, ideal for SLA checks [prctice: check and produce warning])
* Cancellation
  * CancelSafe (will run the CancellationTokenSource.Cancel within try catch and prevent unexpected side effect which can happen when cancellation token registration throw)
* Frendly async locking facilities (which can replace the clasical lock statement).
  * Extensions

Highlights:

* `ReflectionExtensions`: Various helper methods, but one of the most useful features is the GetImplementation method and variations thereof, which allow you to retrieve implementations of a specified base class or interface from an assembly, which is useful for plug-in development.

Contains many exception classes for common basic errors, for instance:

* Null errors, null or white space errors, collection contains nulls, etc.
* Parsing errors, type casting errors
* Not found, not unique errors
* Greater than or equal errors and the like
* Files not found, folder already exists, etc.

There are several advantages over using these exception types.

* Error messages are clear.
* Concise syntax, without sacrificing performance.
* You can pass an expression, whose text becomes part of the message.
* Invalid value is automatically mentioned in the exception message.
* Lose no time typing and trying to come up with a good message.

For example:

	throw new NullException(() => myParent.MyChildren[0].MyProperty);

Will produce an exception message:

	""myParent.MyChildren[0].MyProperty is null.""

This is where it surpasses the possibilities of the C#6 nameof operator, which can only mention a name, not a whole expression.

Another example:

	throw new NotFoundException<Customer>(new { customerNumber, customerType });

will produce an exception message:

	""Customer with key { customerNumber = 1234, customerType = Subscriber } not found.""

As such it is fit for use with any composite key you might have.
			
Some more examples:
			
	throw new NotUniqueException<Product>(productNumber);
	throw new ValueNotSupportedException(myCountryEnumValue);
	throw new FileAlreadyExistsException(""text.txt"");
	throw new NullOrWhiteSpaceException(nameof(myParam));

Those produce the exception messages:
			
	Product with key A123 not unique.
	Country value 'Undefined' is not supported.
	File 'test.txt' already exists.
	myParam is null or white space.

Here is an example with the value check in it:

	if (height < 10) throw new LessThanException(() => height, 10);

This produces the exception message:
				
	height of 2 is less than 10.","exceptions,errors,expressions,strongly-typed,null,white,space,parse,type,casting,found,unique,comparison,file,folder",248,False,1.3.6681.33422
