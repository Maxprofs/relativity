Management operations require the X509Certificate2 type that is not present in the Portable Class Library API surface area. The Common.NetFramework library exposes this functionality. Looking to the future, we are enabling PCL early: Windows Azure Active Directory integration enables token-based authentication. Coupled with appropriate platform-specific libraries, in the future more platforms will light up with support for managing Windows Azure services.

      * CqlSharp is an implementation of the (new) CQL Binary Protocol and therefore requires Cassandra 1.2 and up
      * CqlSharp supports all the binary protocol v2 features: batching, paging, bound query variables, result schema caching, check-and-set (CAS) statements, and sasl-authentication
      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.
      * Configuration is done through connection strings. The simultaneous use of multiple Cassandra clusters is supported.

theeg,2014-03-16T06:54:40.127Z,"DependencyAnalysis is a software testing tool for architectural constraints.

Who are you?

 You are a software developer. You feel a special interest in test driven development, clean code and software architecture.

What do you want?


 What you can see in your every day work, is the code quality level of classes in your IDE. Automated tests can be accessed, approved and extended right away.
 There are hurdles when surveying the software at the architectural level. It requires a tool first. There are quite some available. Now you have chosen for example CoolArchitecture2000 as the weapon of choice. It has a lot of features. But it has a drawback. Anytime you want to check something has changed to the architecture, you have to start that tool.

What is wrong?

We developers are the Montgomery Scotts of our software project. Our place is the machine deck (the IDE). If we had to use the turbolifts to the bridge several times a day to see the results of our work, how long will this process last until we skip the bridge visit? 

Who do you think is responsible for keeping a software architecture in shape?

1. The software architect?
 Well the architect designs dependencies, has an overview of the whole project and bears a vision of the future structure. He suggests technologies to use. Often, he is not the one, who makes daily commits and actively changes the projects structure.

2.Can a dedicated developer be the guardian of architecture?
 This will work for a prolonged time. Once he goes on holiday, no one else will invest the effort required to perform the task of keeping everything in shape. His team mates are not familiar with this task.

3. The answer must be every developer of the team is responsible.
 More or less each team member has an insight at the meta-level of the project he is contributing. This is the source where the check-ins come from. And this is the only instance that can actually influence a growing sofware project.",EggAndGherkin,False,2014-09-29T07:07:14.42-07:00,True,False,DependencyAnalysis is a development tool to qualify the evolvement of your software architecture within predefined limits.

Minification of markup produces by removing extra whitespaces, comments and redundant code (only for HTML and XHTML). In addition, HTML and XHTML minifiers supports the minification of CSS code from style tags and attributes, and minification of JavaScript code from script tags, event attributes and hyperlinks with javascript: protocol. WebMarkupMin.Core contains built-in JavaScript minifier based on the Douglas Crockford's JSMin (http://github.com/douglascrockford/JSMin) and built-in CSS minifier based on the Mads Kristensen's Efficient stylesheet minifier (http://madskristensen.net/post/Efficient-stylesheet-minification-in-C.aspx). The above mentioned minifiers produce only the most simple minifications of CSS and JavaScript code, but you can always install additional modules that support the more powerful algorithms of minification: WebMarkupMin.MsAjax (contains minifier-adapters for the Microsoft Ajax Minifier - http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com) and WebMarkupMin.Yui (contains minifier-adapters for YUI Compressor for .Net - http://yuicompressor.codeplex.com).",WebMarkupMin.Core,False,2017-05-07T11:37:49.133-07:00,True,False,"The Web Markup Minifier (abbreviated WebMarkupMin) is a .NET library that contains a set of markup minifiers.
