It is a tool that takes C/C++ header and library files and generates the necessary glue to surface the native API as a managed API. Such an API can be used to consume an existing native library in your high-level code or add scripting support to a native codebase.

The supported target languages at present are C# and C++/CLI.

It can also be used as a library to parse native code into a syntax tree with a rich declaration and type information model.

Binary 32-bit releases for Windows can be found at https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/releases .",CppSharp,False,2018-02-04T15:09:41.647+00:00,True,False,CppSharp is a collection of libraries for working with C++ code from high-level languages.,,10860,False,0.8.15
