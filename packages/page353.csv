      * Supports fast mapping of objects to query parameters, or query results to objects. Mapping is tunable by decorating your classes via Table and Column attributes.
      * Query tracing, timeouts and cancellation is supported
      * The API is predominately [asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx), heavily relying on the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. Synchronous alternatives are available for convenience.

- SignalR is a library (for web-based Publish/Subscribe -pattern) on top 
  of WebSockets, which is HTML5 API that enables bi-directional communication 
  between the browser and server. SignalR will fallback to other techniques and 
  technologies when WebSockets are not available.
  http://signalr.net/
  
- F-Sharp (F#) is multiparadigm (functional-first) programming language 
  mainly for .NET environment.
  http://fsharp.org/
  
- This sample uses Reactive Extensions 2.1 to communicate with SignalR, 
  on both client and server side. Reactive Extensions is a library to 
  compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable 
  collections and LINQ-style query operators.
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx

- For server side:  
  This could work purely from F# as Owin (http://owin.org/) console application 
  but now F#-server-side is called from an
  empty ASP.NET C# Web Application. (Still you can start OWin from F# Interactive...)

- For client side:
  Silverlight 5.0 application using F#-library
  and Silverlight 5.0 XAML/C# application to show the user interface.
  http://www.silverlight.net
  There is also jQuery/JavaScript test page, if you don't want to use Silverlight.
  
- This proof of concept/sample/tutorial/demo is developed with 
  Visual Studio 2012. References are resolved via NuGet. 
  F# compiler won't auto-restore packages on compile. 
  So go first to Tools -> Library Package Manager -> NuGet
