PicklesDoc and contributors,2015-03-31T12:12:57.283Z,"**Pickles** is an open source **living documentation** generator that works on feature files written in the *Gherkin* language, popularized in tools like *Cucumber* and *SpecFlow*.

        *Pickles* can be incorporated into your build process to produce living documentation in a format that is more accessible to your clients. *Gherkin* language files are written in plain text and stored in your source folder. This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word
        - Excel: Microsoft Excel
        - JSON: a custom JSON format

        Optionally, *Pickles* can **integrate test results**, so that your stakeholders know which scenarios pass validation. *Pickles* supports these test formats:

        - NUnit
        - MSTest
        - XUnit
        - SpecRun

This can make them inaccessible to clients who may not know how to work with source control or who are not interested in seeing all of the source code, just the features.

        *Pickles* can produce output in different formats:

        - Static HTML: a set of HTML files with minimal JavaScript
        - Dynamic HTML: a JavaScript-rich single page app with integrated search
        - Word: Microsoft Word

http://alphachitech.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/virtualizing-observable-collection/

GitHub is here: https://github.com/anagram4wander/VirtualizingObservableCollection

There are no performant large data set observable collections that support write operations in .NET, so we wrote the VirtualizingObservableCollection, which does the following:
◾Implements the same interfaces as ObsevableCollection<T> so you can use it anywhere you’d use an ObsevableCollection<T> – no need to change any of your existing controls.
◾Supports true multi-user read/write without resets (maximizing performance for large-scale concurrency scenarios).
◾Manages memory on its own so it never runs out of memory, no matter how large the data set is (especially important for mobile devices).
◾Natively works asynchronously – great for slow network connections and occasionally-connected models.
◾Works great out of the box, but is flexible and extendable enough to customize for your needs.
◾Has a data access performance curve nearly as good as the regular ObsevableCollection – the cost of using it is negligible.
◾Works in any .NET project because it’s implemented in a Portable Code Library (PCL).",VirtualizingObservableCollection,False,2015-03-31T11:43:02.803-07:00,True,False,PCL Implementation of a VirtualizingObservableCollection that implements full editing and is highly performing.,"mvvm,wpf,windowsstore,win8,windowsphone,windowsphone8,xamarin,xaramin.forms,virtualization",8040,False,1.2.0
