To support .NET core 2.0, common is refined to supported 4.6.2 first. Meanwhile, regarding unavoidable incompatibility between .NET framework and .NET
core, implementation and scope have to be changed to meet goal.

 

Scope Change (Based on aspects)

-   Kept:

    -   Common contracts and entity interfaces.

    -   AOP

    -   Restful API

    -   Reflection

    -   Http enhancements and extension. (System.Web based classes is supported in .NET framework only.)

    -   Sandbox and dynamic compiling.

    -   Data access controller (for Microsoft SQL Server)

-   New:

    -   HttpRequestMessage + HttpResponseMessage supports.

-   Removed:

    -   System.Draw based.

    -   Win Form/WPF UI based.

    -   LDAP extension.

-   As new library:

Bytescout BarCode Reader SDK provides functionality for reading linear and 2-dimensional barcodes 
from JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF images and PDF documents.

System Requirements: .NET Framework 2.0 or later
Works with: .NET, ASP.NET, ActiveX, Visual Basic 6, Classic ASP, Delphi and others.

ONLINE DOCUMENTATION: https://bytescout.com/files/help/BytescoutBarCodeReaderSDK/index.html

BENEFITS: 
- Read barcodes from from JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF images and PDF documents;
- Reads one-dimensional (linear) barcodes: Code 128, Code 39, Code 93, Tripotic, GS1-128, GS1-DataBar, 
  EAN-13, EAN-8, Patch Code, Postnet, ITF-14, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPC-A, UPC-E, Codabar, Royal Mail, 
  Intelligent Mail, Royal Mail KIX, Australia PostCode and many more;
- Reads two-dimensional barcodes: PDF417, DataMatrix, QR Code, Aztec, MaxiCode, Codablock F, Code 16K, MICR font and others;
- Barcode reader returns: barcode type, decode string value, barcode bounds;
- Supports reading of multiple barcodes from one image; 
- Reads from PDF files without any other tools required;
- Reads from multi-page TIFF images; 

TRAIL VERSION LIMITATIONS:
 - Adds reminder text message to output barcode value.
