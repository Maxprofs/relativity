Once a REST-service is defined it can be consumed via regular URL, or using client-side javascript call that resembles the standard C# style function call that is expected to be used within server-side code calling the same method. The REST-service can return any type of data, such as string, byte array, reference to a file that should be sent to a client as a call response, etc. In addition HTML templates functionality can be utilized by building an ascx file template (like regular web user controls) and data model that REST-service method is supposed to return – the framework will process ASCX template by applying data model to it and returning its result to the client. The REST-service framework also provides control over security, and has built-in configuration that is 100% controlled by a developer, including ability to use class alias instead of real class to hide the internal namespaces and classes’ structure used by the server code backend.

Disclaimer: The main purpose of building this framework was to allow the creation of HTTP or REST services in such a way that is easy to use, easy to setup, to not be limited by returned type of data, and making sure that the internal application code can be reused for service purposes.

This optimizes the out-of-proc ASP.NET session management and increases the overall site performance. These subsets of data can also be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

As an additional functionality, the library provides ""Cache-On-Demand"" that functions as an external out-of-process cache shared by all servers on web-farm. This cached data can be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

All functionality is highly configurable and extendable.

The FlexiCache 1.1 has ability automatically collect meta data (metatags) for each cached resource or accept custom meta tags. This provides further functionality to remove the cached data by using application meaningful information embedded in the metatags. The removal process is based on application business logic.

It includes the MongoDB and SQL Server output cache providers extending ASP.NET Output Cache capabilities by allowing to store cached data outside of the application process that is especially important in web-farm scenario.

This library provides ""Session-On-Demand"" functionality - ability to separate ASP.NET Session data to subsets that can be stored outside of the main ASP.NET session and loaded on demand when it's really used rather on every request. This optimizes the out-of-proc ASP.NET session management and increases the overall site performance. These subsets of data can also be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

As an additional functionality, the library provides ""Cache-On-Demand"" that functions as an external out-of-process cache shared by all servers on web-farm. This cached data can be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

All functionality is highly configurable and extendable.

The FlexiCache 1.1 has ability automatically collect meta data (metatags) for each cached resource or accept custom meta tags. This provides further functionality to remove the cached data by using application meaningful information embedded in the metatags. The removal process is based on application business logic. The Output Cache Provider is able to automatically build meta tags collection from query string and form parameters. The result metatags have the following format: ""userid=12345"", where UserId was a form or query string parameter that was supplied with the request.",FlexiCache,False,2013-03-10T09:31:16.783-07:00,True,False,This library provides extended cache and session capabilities to the ASP.NET applications by allowing to store cached data outside of the application.

This optimizes the out-of-proc ASP.NET session management and increases the overall site performance. These subsets of data can also be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

As an additional functionality, the library provides ""Cache-On-Demand"" that functions as an external out-of-process cache shared by all servers on web-farm. This cached data can be stored either in MongoDB and SQL Server. 

All functionality is highly configurable and extendable.

The FlexiCache 1.1 has ability automatically collect meta data (metatags) for each cached resource or accept custom meta tags. This provides further functionality to remove the cached data by using application meaningful information embedded in the metatags. The removal process is based on application business logic.
