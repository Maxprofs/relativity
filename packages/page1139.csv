This makes it easier to create cross-platform .NET apps and have cross platform settings. Manage and use all settings from one PCL and save natively on each platform. *This plugin stores settings natively on each platform and does NOT save them to Json. This allows you to use native functionality such as PreferenceActivity on Android.
