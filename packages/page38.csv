ZXing (pronounced ""zebra crossing"") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages. Our focus is on using the built-in camera on mobile phones to scan and decode barcodes on the device, without communicating with a server. However the project can be used to encode and decode barcodes on desktops and servers as well.",ZXing,False,2013-07-11T10:52:57.64-07:00,True,,,36713,False,1.7.0
