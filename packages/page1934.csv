Polaris has many ready to use extensions and lambda friendly behaviors like map - reductions, comparisons, chainers, iterators and more, let you implement complex algorithms in a clear, brief but surprisingly expressive and lightning fast fashion.

Enigma simplifies the use of the most popular and recurrent cryptographic operations and algorithms like hashing with SHA256 or encrypting/decrypting with RSA15 and X509 certificates.
