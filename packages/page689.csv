Microsoft,2014-12-20T00:51:05.463Z,"This package provides APIs for accessing CPU-specific Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations. SIMD allows parallelizing certain operations at the hardware level. This is especially useful in domains that perform computations over vectors, such as graphics, gaming, mathematics or finance.

      The types in this package are implemented in IL which allows them to be used on non-SIMD enabled JIT compilers and hardware. However, in order to actually use SIMD instructions, you'll need to run on a JIT compiler that knows about these types in order to emit SIMD instructions. The JIT shipped with the current .NET runtime does not. The .NET code generation team has published a CTP of the the new JIT, codenamed ""RyuJIT"". The CTP adds SIMD support when compiling for x64.

The goal is to have an easy-to-use and uniform yet modular and pluggable facility to handle common cross-cutting concerns in my applications, thereby freeing me up to focus on the actual application concerns and hopefully making it easier and faster to build them.
      In general, the library consists of interfaces or SPIs along with ways to access them (using MEF). One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.
