Michael Rodda,2013-07-31T09:52:19.553Z,"What is Radiator?

Radiator is a small framework that provides functionlity to execute and validate commands. The point of the framework is to work in conjuction with the CQRS (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) methodology. This framework does not provide Event Sourcing or Querying. This framework is purely for command execution and validation. This framework was first built to be used with MVC web projects, however it could be used in any kind of project and there is no reference or dependance on MVC.


How to use it?

The goal is to have an easy-to-use and uniform yet modular and pluggable facility to handle common cross-cutting concerns in my applications, thereby freeing me up to focus on the actual application concerns and hopefully making it easier and faster to build them.
      In general, the library consists of interfaces or SPIs along with ways to access them (using MEF). One can then build implementations for these interfaces (i.e. providers) and hook them up to an application through configuration. What this does for me is provide a uniform way to access these services in all my applications while allowing me to switch or extend providers as I see fit.

Either 32-bit or 64-bit filters will be used depending on the processor architecture of the host process.

For 32-bit hosts the C# compiler enables Data Execution Prevention for the process, as many filters are not compatible with it you should use editbin or a similar tool to clear the IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NX_COMPAT flag
(see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ed_maurer/archive/2007/12/14/nxcompat-and-the-c-compiler.aspx for more details).

When using .NET 3.0 and later 8-bit and 16-bit Grayscale and RGB(A) images can be processed using WIC.
The .NET 2.0 version uses GDIPlus which does not support 16-bit data and processes images as 32-bit ARGB.
