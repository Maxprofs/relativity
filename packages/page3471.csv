-Ability to perform single and batch processing of CRUD operations on all QuickBooks entities.

-Request and Response Handler has common interface with two implemented classes to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

-Support for both XML and JSON Request and Response format.

-Ability to configure app settings in the configuration file requiring no additional code change.

-Support for Gzip and Deflate compression formats to improve performance of QuickBooks API calls.

-Retry policy constructors to help apps handle transient errors.

-Logging mechanisms for trace, request/response, and Azure logging.

* Parsing errors, type casting errors

There are several advantages over using these exception types.

* Error messages are clear.
* Concise syntax, without sacrificing performance.
* You can pass an expression, whose text becomes part of the message.
* Lose no time typing and trying to come up with a good message.

For example:

	throw new NullException(() => myParent.MyChildren[0].MyProperty);

Will produce an exception message:

	""myParent.MyChildren[0].MyProperty is null.""

This is where it surpasses the possibilities of the C#6 nameof operator, which can only mention a name, not a whole expression.

Another example:

	throw new NotFoundException<Customer>(new { customerNumber });

will produce an exception message:

	""Customer with key { customerNumber = 1234 } not found.""

	throw new NotUniqueException<Product>(productNumber);
	throw new ValueNotSupportedException(myCountryEnumValue);
	throw new FileAlreadyExistsException(""text.txt"");
	throw new NullOrWhiteSpaceException(() => myParam.MyProp);

	Product with key A123 not unique.
	Country value 'Undefined' is not supported.

	myParam.MyProp is null or white space.
