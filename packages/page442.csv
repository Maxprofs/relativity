Venetasoft,2014-03-04T04:30:51.553Z,"WP7 and WP8 SMTP client library to send emails without using the EmailComposeTask, and attach any type of file.

Main Features:

• connects to Microsoft Live, Gmail or to a custom SMTP mail server (SSL/TLS compatible).
• supports any kind of attachment, from resource or isolated storage: pdf, mp3, wav, mp4, avi, bmp, txt, zip, jpg, etc.

• multithreaded: will not freeze/block your UI.
• works on wifi and data connection.
• supports international charset (Chinese).


Usage scenario:

//create a new MailMessage object
MailMessage mailMessage = new MailMessage();

//set a Live/Hotmail or Gmail, or a custom SMTP account
mailMessage.UserName= ""*****@hotmail.com;
mailMessage.Password = ""********"";
