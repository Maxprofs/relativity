Rolosoft Ltd,2013-10-04T16:37:54.49Z,905,1659,"Use this component where automated Aweber list management is needed from, for example, back end services such as user registration in web applications.

**ABOUT**
Aweber offers excellent email campaign list management services and is mainly geared for capturing email addresses via its own javascript based email web forms.

Whilst this (i.e. Aweber web capture forms) is great if your requirement is directly capturing email addresses via web sites, it's not so useful if you need to subscribe and unsubscribe users directly from a back end service such as a CRM or lead management system.

Aweber do not accept (there are AUP exclusions in its T's and C's) on any form of ""automated"" subscription method that goes via its web form entry systems so it's not possible to automatically sign up users by using HTTP POST integration.

Fortunately, there is a work around using SMTP. This software is completely SMTP based and does not break any existing Aweber terms and conditions of use.

**ABOUT**
Aweber offers excellent email campaign list management services and is mainly geared for capturing email addresses via its own javascript based email web forms.

Whilst this (i.e. Aweber web capture forms) is great if your requirement is directly capturing email addresses via web sites, it's not so useful if you need to subscribe and unsubscribe users directly from a back end service such as a CRM or lead management system.

Aweber do not accept (there are AUP exclusions in its T's and C's) on any form of ""automated"" subscription method that goes via its web form entry systems so it's not possible to automatically sign up users by using HTTP POST integration.

Fortunately, there is a work around using SMTP. This software is completely SMTP based and does not break any existing Aweber terms and conditions of use.
