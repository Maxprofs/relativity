Chris Edwards,2012-09-21T18:49:30.947Z,Fluency is a factory that creates object graphs populated with fake data. Fluency exposes a customizeable fluent interface that constructs test objects (including the full graph of dependencies). Yet it only requires you to specify the few things your test is actually concerned with--everything else is automatically populated with random (yet valid) data. Fluency comes complete with a very functional set of realistic random data generators that can be configured on a case-by-case basis or by convention to give you complete control over the randomness of your data.,Fluency,False,2018-02-02T22:36:41.07+00:00,True,False,,"testing,anonymous,fluentinterface,object,builder,net,dotnet,library,framework,csharp,c#,development,fluent,fluent-interface,test,data,factory",11432,False,1.0.42
