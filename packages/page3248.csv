** OCR **

Rapidly develop robust, scalable, and high-performance recognition and document processing applications that extract text from scanned documents and convert images to text-searchable formats such as PDF, PDF/A, DOC, DOCX, XML, and XPS. Supports 40+ character sets.  This package includes English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. For more languages, see the Leadtools.Ocr.Languages.* packages.


** MICR **

Create processes that automatically detect and extract MICR E-13B and CMC-7 text from personal, corporate, government, and bank checks. 


** OMR **

Leverage the high-level LEADTOOLS OMR toolkit to rapidly develop robust, high-performance recognition applications which detect whether boxes are checked and bubbles are filled within surveys and tests.


** 1D and 2D Barcode **

Detect, read, and write 1D and 2D barcodes in images. LEADTOOLS supports more than 100 different barcode types and sub-types such as UPC, EAN, Code 128, QR Code, Data Matrix, and PDF417.


** Forms Recognition and Processing **

Detect and process unstructured and semi-structured documents such as bubble forms, invoices, checks, passports, driver's licenses, and credit cards. LEADTOOLS Forms uses an advanced combination of OCR, OMR, ICR, barcode, image cleanup and more to automate the extraction of text from complex documents.


** PDF **

With LEADTOOLS comprehensive PDF technology, you can:

• View and Convert as vector
• Merge, Split, Convert, Linearize, Optimize, Compress, and Distill 
• Extract text, bookmarks, hyperlinks, metadata, and more 
• Convert between images, such as JPEG and TIFF, and searchable or image-based PDFs


** Bitonal and Color Image Processing **

Clean images improve recognition accuracy, speed, and compression ratios. Cleanup functions can remove skewed angles, hole punches, borders, dust specks, and more.


** Annotation and Mark-up **

Diverse collection of markup objects and collaborative tools designed to impart visual metadata upon images and documents. LEADTOOLS also supports specialized document and medical annotations for PDF and DICOM.

LEADTOOLS JPIP technology is an implementation of the JPEG 2000, part 9 standard (ISO/IEC 15444-9) and includes metadata and codestream elements. The JPIP client/server architecture is designed to store large, compressed JPEG 2000 images on the server, while transmitting image resolution, quality, and region of interest (ROI) as specified by the client.  Clients can view stored images without needing to download and decode the entire image. 

LEADTOOLS JPIP SDK technology is comprised of high-level components that you can easily plug into enterprise client/server applications to immediately start streaming high-resolution images—even over low-bandwidth connections.

** Medical Viewing and Annotation **

The LEADTOOLS Medical Viewer Control is a high-level component for developers to build medical display solutions such as view stations, teleradiology applications, and high-end diagnostic workstations found in radiology and other medical specialty departments.  Whether you are building a PACS viewer for radiology, cardiology, mammography, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology, dentistry, or any other specialty, the DICOM Viewer Control eliminates complexity from your projects and sets a solid DICOM and imaging foundation on which you can rely.  For an HTML5/JavaScript Zero-footprint version of the Medical Viewer, go to https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/html5

LEADTOOLS DICOM Annotations provides two different means for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS annotations in a DICOM data set.

   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).

   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.


** 3D Reconstruction and Visualization **

LEADTOOLS provides world-class Medical 3D technology that reconstructs three-dimensional visual representations from two-dimensional image slices, such as MRI and CT stacks. LEADTOOLS Medical 3D Technology offers many different data representations using various 3D reconstruction techniques such as MPR, VRT, MIP, MinIP, and SSD, and projection techniques that support clipping planes, slab, scale, zoom, camera control, threshold, transparency, and image processing.


** DICOM Data Set **

LEADTOOLS provides complete support for DICOM data sets described in the latest DICOM specification and supplements, including all IOD classes and modalities such as CR, CT, MR, NM, US, RF, SC, and VL.


** Image Processing **

LEADTOOLS includes libraries that offer an advanced set of functions specially designed to enhance and analyze medical images regardless of the format or data distribution. You can enhance the image or highlight the details by shifting, selecting, subtracting, and removing the background. This flexibility allows doctors and specialists to diagnose diseases and injuries faster and more accurately.

This package contains LEADTOOLS user interface controls for applications targeting the .NET Windows Forms platform.


** Medical Viewing and Annotation **

The LEADTOOLS Medical Viewer Control is a high-level component for developers to build medical display solutions such as view stations, teleradiology applications, and high-end diagnostic workstations found in radiology and other medical specialty departments.  Whether you are building a PACS viewer for radiology, cardiology, mammography, ophthalmology, pathology, dermatology, dentistry, or any other specialty, the DICOM Viewer Control eliminates complexity from your projects and sets a solid DICOM and imaging foundation on which you can rely.  For an HTML5/JavaScript Zero-footprint version of the Medical Viewer, go to https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/html5

LEADTOOLS DICOM Annotations provides two different means for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS annotations in a DICOM data set.

   1. In Part 3 of the DICOM Specification, the description for the “Graphic Annotation Module” describes how Annotations are to be stored in a DICOM Presentation State. The “Graphic Annotation Module” includes Text Objects, Graphic Objects, and Compound Graphics. LEADTOOLS has full support for converting between the LEADTOOLS Annotations and the DICOM Graphic Annotation Module in a DICOM Presentation State (i.e., DICOM Annotations).

   2. Alternatively, there is support for reading and writing legacy LEADTOOLS Annotations in the LEAD Native format as a private element in a DICOM data set.


** 3D Reconstruction and Visualization **

LEADTOOLS provides world-class Medical 3D technology that reconstructs three-dimensional visual representations from two-dimensional image slices, such as MRI and CT stacks. LEADTOOLS Medical 3D Technology offers many different data representations using various 3D reconstruction techniques such as MPR, VRT, MIP, MinIP, and SSD, and projection techniques that support clipping planes, slab, scale, zoom, camera control, threshold, transparency, and image processing.


** DICOM Data Set **

LEADTOOLS provides complete support for DICOM data sets described in the latest DICOM specification and supplements, including all IOD classes and modalities such as CR, CT, MR, NM, US, RF, SC, and VL.


** Image Processing **

LEADTOOLS includes libraries that offer an advanced set of functions specially designed to enhance and analyze medical images regardless of the format or data distribution. You can enhance the image or highlight the details by shifting, selecting, subtracting, and removing the background. This flexibility allows doctors and specialists to diagnose diseases and injuries faster and more accurately.
