Microsoft PROgram Synthesis using Examples SDK (PROSE) is a framework of technologies for automatic generation of programs from input-output examples, keywords, and similar forms of imprecise specification. In PROSE, you define a domain-specific language (DSL) of programs that constitute your domain of useful tasks (e.g. a DSL of CSS selectors). At runtime, you give PROSE some (typically user-provided) input-output examples for the desired program's behavior, and its algorithms synthesize a ranked set of programs from this DSL that are consistent with the given examples. These programs can be saved and applied on similar user data after one learning session (typically with 1-4 examples). PROSE can be used to enable programming-by-example experience in an arbitrary user-facing application, provided the app developer describes its application domain in a DSL form.

As part of the project, the PROSE framework includes a set of specific technologies for various data wrangling domains. These include Transformation.Text, a library of string transformations first shipped as FlashFill in Microsoft Excel 2013, text extraction library with a DSL of programs that find a desired sequence of regions in a textual file, and several others. All of these data wrangling libraries, as well as the underlying program synthesis framework, can currently be used out of the box for research, education, and other non-commercial initiatives.",Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis,False,2018-04-16T18:16:55.963+00:00,True,False,Library for automatically synthesizing programs from examples.,"Program,Synthesis,SDK",6042,True,4.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------ 
What is ConceptNet? 
ConceptNet is a freely-available semantic network, designed to help 
computers understand the meanings of words that people use.  
(http://conceptnet.io) 

------------------------------------------------------------ 
How to use this package? 
** var wrapper = new ConceptNetWrapper(""http://api.conceptnet.io"");  ** 
The wrapper get as first argument the base URL for the ConceptNet API. 
The second argument (non-mandatory) is the language, the default is ""en"" (i.e., english). 
The third argument (non-mandatory) is the filter language results, Filter the results which are not the from the defined language (default is true). 

Example: 
Getting the relations for the term 'example' 
** var result = wrapper.GetConceptRelationsAsString(""example""); ** 
Results are shown in the following format: 
Start (start node - e.g., 'example'), Rel ('type of relation'), End (end node), Text 
- Rel describes one of the defined relations that connect the nodes of ConceptNet. 
- Some of ConceptNet's data is extracted from natural-language text. The Text value shows you what this text was. 

Some Results: 
// apology,IsA,example,[[apology]] is a type of [[example]] 
// example,IsA,admonition,[[example]] is a type of [[admonition]] 
------------------------------------------------------------

** Wrapper wrapper = new Wrapper(""http://api.conceptnet.io"");  ** 
The wrapper get as first argument the base URL for the ConceptNet API. 
The second argument (non-mandatory) is the language, the default is ""en"" (i.e., english). 
The third argument (non-mandatory) is the filter language results, Filter the results which are not the from the defined language (default is true). 

Example: 
Getting the relations for the term 'example' 
** var result = wrapper.GetConceptRelationsAsString(""example""); ** 
Results are shown in the following format: 
Start (start node - e.g., 'example'), Rel ('type of relation'), End (end node), Text 
- Rel describes one of the defined relations that connect the nodes of ConceptNet. 
- Some of ConceptNet's data is extracted from natural-language text. The Text value shows you what this text was. 

Some Results: 
// apology,IsA,example,[[apology]] is a type of [[example]] 
// example,IsA,admonition,[[example]] is a type of [[admonition]] 
------------------------------------------------------------ 
Other examples: 

** var result2 = wrapper.GetConceptRelationsAsString(""blabla""); //Return empty string, since this term doesn't exist** 

** var result3 = wrapper.GetConceptNetResults(""dog"", ""bark""); //Return the relations between these two terms** 

** var result4 = wrapper.GetConceptRelationsAsString(""dog"", ""bark""); //Return the relations between these two terms as comma separated string ** 

** var result5 = wrapper.GetConceptRelationsAsDataTable(""dog"", ""bark""); //Return the relations between these two terms in data table format ** 

** var result6 = wrapper.GetRelatedTerms(""Tea Kettle"");  // Return terms related to the term (e.g., ""cat"") ** 

** var result7 = wrapper.GetHowTermsRelated(""tea_kettle"", ""coffee_pot""); // If you just want to see how related term1 (e.g., ""tea kettle"") is to term2 (e.g., ""coffee pot"") ** 

** var result8 = crawler.GetRelationScore(""tea_kettle"", ""coffee_pot""); //Return the relation score ** 

** 
	var result9 = crawler.GetConceptNetQueryResults(""node=/c/en/dog,other=/c/en/bark""); //Get results based on query (comma seperated string ) 
	// You can specify any of the following parameters:  
	// start: a URI that the ""start"" or ""subject"" position must match. 
	// end: a URI that the ""end"" or ""object"" position must match. 
	// rel: a relation. node: a URI that must match either the start or the end. 
	// other: a URI that must match either the start or the end, and be different from node. 
	// sources: a URI that must match one of the sources of the edge.
