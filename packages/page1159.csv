Why?
Unlike most application server frameworks, which are implemented over slow stateless protocols such as HTTP, REST and SOAP that use bulky ASCII data formats such as JSON and XML, DotNetOpenServer has been built from the ground up for speed and efficiency. 

How does it work?
DotNetOpenServer implements a fast stateful binary protocol stack that supports SSL/TLS 1.2, includes a Windows Authentication Protocol, enables developers to extend the framework with any authentication method and provides a robust connection through a Keep-Alive Protocol (AKA Heartbeat Protocol).
