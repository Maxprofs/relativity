WinSW provides a CL for installation and management of Windows services. It also offers many advanced options, which can be configured via additional XML file. Several examples: logging of spawned executables with log rotation, automated update of files from URL, runaway process termination, shared directory mapping on startup, etc.

			## Features

			* Create your apps in PCL and run them everywhere, truly multi-platform (web included)
			* The UI is defined from code (XAML designer on the way)
			* 100% native controls are used in all platforms
			* You have only the ""common"" UI api surface among all platforms
			* Supports click, doble click and, for user input controls, value changed events
			* Using OKHOSTING.UI.CSS you can use CSS files to define the styles of your controls on all platforms (thanks to AngleSharp)

			## Supported controls

			* Autocomplete
			* Button
			* Calendar
			* CheckBox
			* HyperLink
			* Image
			* Label
			* ListPicker (equivalent to a DropDownList)
			* PasswordTextBox

GitHub: https://github.com/tyrotoxin/AsyncEnumerable

PROBLEM SPACE

Helps to (a) create an element provider, where producing an element can take a lot of time
due to dependency on other asynchronous events (e.g. wait handles, network streams), and
(b) a consumer that processes those element as soon as they are ready without blocking
the thread (the processing is scheduled on a worker thread instead).


EXAMPLE

using System.Collections.Async;

static IAsyncEnumerable<int> ProduceAsyncNumbers(int start, int end)
{
  return new AsyncEnumerable<int>(async yield => {

    // Just to show that ReturnAsync can be used multiple times
    await yield.ReturnAsync(start);

    for (int number = start + 1; number <= end; number++)
      await yield.ReturnAsync(number);

    // You can break the enumeration loop with the following call:
    yield.Break();

    // This won't be executed due to the loop break above
    await yield.ReturnAsync(12345);
  });
}

// Just to compare with synchronous version of enumerator
static IEnumerable<int> ProduceNumbers(int start, int end)
{
  yield return start;

  for (int number = start + 1; number <= end; number++)
    yield return number;

  yield break;

  yield return 12345;
}

{
  var asyncEnumerableCollection = ProduceAsyncNumbers(start: 1, end: 10);
  await asyncEnumerableCollection.ForEachAsync(async number => {
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($""{number}"");
  });
}

// Just to compare with synchronous version of enumeration
