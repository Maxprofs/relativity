James Dunne,2015-03-02T14:02:38.623Z,"Aardwolf is an asynchronous HTTP API service provider for C# that does not depend on ASP.NET nor IIS. Aardwolf is based on the HttpListener API provided as part of the .NET framework and the Windows implementation makes use of the low-level HTTP.SYS driver to handle and queue HTTP requests in the kernel and forward those to user-mode applications. IIS versions 6 and up make use of this same HTTP.SYS driver so it is a trusted and well-tested component that can be relied upon for production scenarios.

The Aardwolf framework builds an asynchronous request event loop to handle HTTP requests, taking full advantage of the asynchronous features of the .NET 4.5 framework. A very simple and efficient C# library is exposed to the developer who wants to write fast, asynchronous web services or web sites.

At this time, the framework is solid and runs very efficiently. However, it is incomplete with regard to features.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and about 75x faster than SharpMimeTools).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.

IIS versions 6 and up make use of this same HTTP.SYS driver so it is a trusted and well-tested component that can be relied upon for production scenarios.

The Aardwolf framework builds an asynchronous request event loop to handle HTTP requests, taking full advantage of the asynchronous features of the .NET 4.5 framework. A very simple and efficient C# library is exposed to the developer who wants to write fast, asynchronous web services or web sites.
