PDF standard versions supported are: ALL versions. 
Files can be normal, linearized, password-protected, signed, incrementally updated.

- We support many possible PDF content manipulations scenarios, below are a few things that worth mentioning:
- Extract, modify and add graphics (text, images, drawings)
- Split or merge PDF documents
- Extract PDF text to HTML, Tagged or Raw format
- Fill or create PDF forms
- Add or remove document fields
- Examine resources within a document - fonts, embedded files
- Digitally sign and check existing signatures on PDF documents
- Search for specific text
- Protect document with a password
- Work with navigation objects, e.g. create bookmarks or links
- Full support for annotations
- Full support for PDF actions
- All fonts defined by specification are supported
- Various colorspaces and color profiles are supported, e.g. you may draw in RGB, CMYK, gray, or whatever colorspace you like.
- Files can be saved to other “subtypes” of PDF – Linearized or PDF/a for example.
- If you require a specific funtionality and are unsure about whether it is supported, please review our online help or contact support so we'll be able to handle this.
- Fixed layout API, implemented to be 100% PDF specification compatible, it unlocks full power of the PDF for you. Any complex PDF creation or manipulation task can be completed instantly.

From the OSGeo website: “FDO Data Access Technology is an API for manipulating, defining and analyzing geospatial information regardless of where it is stored. FDO uses a provider-based model for supporting a variety of geospatial data sources, where each provider typically supports a particular data format or data store.”

** This is a repackage of the third party FDO project for use with ThinkGeo's Map Suite product line.  **
** You should not need to reference this package directly. It will be a dependency of other Map Suite packages. **

The purpose of the repackage is to enable ThinkGeo to control release and debug versions known to be compatible with various Map Suite products and to provide ongoing backward compatibility independent from the original author.  You can find more information at the link below.
