Because the ID3 specification is so ridiculously complicated and because only a small subset of its features and versions are in common use, the NTagLite library is deliberately designed to be ""lightweight"" in the sense that it supports only the most common and practically useful subset of ID3 features. This subset is still a significant part of the full specification.

Greg Keogh,2016-02-17T10:59:18.16Z,621,793,"Author's note: In recent years I was frustrated in attempts to find a public, documented and comprehensible managed library for manipulating ID3 tagged files. As the project Wiki page explains, in 2014 I reluctantly created this library to satisfy the requirement for an easy-to-use lightweight library that can manipulate all of the most commonly encountered features of the ID3 informal standards. Because the ID3 specification is so ridiculously complicated and because only a small subset of its features and versions are in common use, the NTagLite library is deliberately designed to be ""lightweight"" in the sense that it supports only the most common and practically useful subset of ID3 features. This subset is still a significant part of the full specification.
