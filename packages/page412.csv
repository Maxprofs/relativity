      JQuery 2.x does not support IE6/7/8 Any longer. If you plan to support browsers before IE9 you must use JQuery 1.x
      Updating JQuery will update your package to version 2+ of JQuery. This package is JQuery1 and can be installed along with jQuery in the same project. 
      At the top of your View you would then include a directive for example like this.

      According to JQuery there will be new versions of JQuery 1.x in the future.  This package will be updated to reflect that change and ease deployment.

      if it isn't already checked out before modification.
