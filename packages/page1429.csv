A Mechanism is by definition a Gear, so you can create new Mechanisms by mixing and matching existing Mechanisms and Gears you have already in your library.

Clockwork include a large library of ready to use Gears to for example do declarative validations, make other Gears asynchronous, and even bind other KEYSTONE components to the Clockwork paradigm.
