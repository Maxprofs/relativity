Traditionally, programmers often use `null` references to represent values that ""aren't there"", but the problem is that this was never their intended purpose. 

- Languages like C# don't provide a way to differentiate between reference variables that can be null and those that are guaranteed not to be.
- The inventor of null references has [apologized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Quotations) for creating them in the first place, calling them his ""billion-dollar mistake.""
- This misuse of null references has spread far and wide, leading to the unfortunately-named `Nullable<>` type (which, being a value type, is never actually null), and attributes like `[CanBeNull]` and `[NotNull]` to help programmers know when they can expect a method to treat a null value as legitimate input.

All this leaves us in a position where our best hope of avoiding `NullReferenceException`s lies in trying to make sure that our reference variables are *never* null. But in that case, how do we indicate when a value is *optional*?

Well, that's where `Maybe<>` comes in.",CallMeMaybe,False,2017-10-11T04:16:35.657+00:00,True,False,A C# library to help you deal with optional values.,"maybe,monad,option,optional",5946,False,0.3.5252
