Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers.

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

	    to the original source or is not convenient/efficient to do so. Afterthought runs as a post-build step

	    others. The amendments allow you to add or modify the behavior of constructors, properties, methods, or 
	    events, and add new fields and attributes. Amendments can also modify types to implement new interfaces. 
	    The modified assembly just includes simple static calls into existing code that you write in a natural

The log4net package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial. 

At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4net is the notion of hierarchical loggers. Using these loggers it is possible to selectively control which log statements are output at arbitrary granularity.

**ABOUT**
Aweber offers excellent email campaign list management services and is mainly geared for capturing email addresses via its own javascript based email web forms.

Whilst this (i.e. Aweber web capture forms) is great if your requirement is directly capturing email addresses via web sites, it's not so useful if you need to subscribe and unsubscribe users directly from a back end service such as a CRM or lead management system.

Aweber do not accept (there are AUP exclusions in its T's and C's) on any form of ""automated"" subscription method that goes via its web form entry systems so it's not possible to automatically sign up users by using HTTP POST integration.

Fortunately, there is a work around using SMTP. This software is completely SMTP based and does not break any existing Aweber terms and conditions of use.
