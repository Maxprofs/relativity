Stefan Troschütz <stefan@troschuetz.de>,2013-04-07T16:32:17.143Z,40,1839,"Fully managed library providing various random number generators and distributions.
      More precisely, this library offers four generators (ALF, MT19937, Standard, XorShift128), six discrete distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Categorical, DiscreteUniform, Geometric, Poisson) and twenty continuous distributions (like Normal, Exponential, ChiSquare, Beta, and so on); moreover, it offers a random class similar to the one Python offers (TRandom).
      All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Troschütz, and for which I thank him very much. What I am doing with his great project, is simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering the new random class similar to the one Python offers.
