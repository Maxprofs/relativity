ThinkGeo,2017-03-08T03:35:34.733Z,4,408,"LibGeoTiff  is a  .NET wrapper to help with using the GeoTiff format.

From the OSGeo website: “GeoTIFF represents an effort by over 160 different remote sensing, GIS, cartographic, and surveying related companies and organizations to establish a TIFF based interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery.”

** This is a repackage of the third party LibGeoTiff project for use with ThinkGeo's Map Suite product line.  **
** You should not need to reference this package directly, it will be a dependency of other Map Suite packages. **

The purpose of the repackage is to enable ThinkGeo to control release and debug versions known to be compatible with various Map Suite products and to provide ongoing backward compatibility independent from the original author.  You can find more information at the link below.

The ValueStyle allows you to match data in the FeatureSource against a value string. If the value matches, then we will use the style defined in that item to do the drawing. For example, let's say you have some data that contains states, and each state is categorized as either a high, medium or low pollution state. Based on the string values of ""High"", Medium"" and ""Low"", we can match on these. If a feature's data for the column matched the string ""High"", then we would use the high ValueItem's styles to draw that feature. This can be applied to all kinds of things such as road classification and more.

For example, you may have a ShapeFile comprised of states that has the populations of each state as part of its data. You may then want to color states differently based on their population. This ClassBreakStyle allows you to do this.
