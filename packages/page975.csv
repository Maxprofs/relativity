There are 3 layers of security to prevent abuse. 

1. The API signs the remote url with HMAC SHA-256 to prevent anyone from tampering or generating them without access to the signing key.
2. A whitelist approach is taken to sites. By default, no sites are allowed. You must handle the RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.AllowRemoteRequest event to permit sites (or portions of sites) to be relayed.
4. The  plugin requires that all remote images be decoded and re-encoded. Files are never returned as-is. This ensures that the files are valid images, and prevents XSS attacks.

Please note, you must configure the <remotereader signingKey=""to a long and secure pass phrase"" /> and set <remotereader allowAllSignedRequests=""true"" /> if all code calling RemoteReaderPlugin.Current.CreateSignedUrl(remoteUrl,settings) is trusted.

"Nathanael Jones,Imazen",2015-07-07T18:14:06.41Z,"Lightweight HttpModule, REST API, and managed API for *safe* and highly-optimized server-side image processing. 

Docs: http://imageresizing.net/

Support: http://imageresizing.net/support

Works with .NET 4.5.1+, ASP.NET WebForms, MVC 1-4, WebAPI, Routing, IIS 7, 7.5, & 8, 8.1 and nearly all CMSes.

Use ether the URL API: image.jpg?width=100&height=100 *or* the Managed API: ImageBuilder.Current.Build(source,dest,settings).

ImageResizer provides incredible quality and highly-optimized image processing - by default. Don't leak memory by using System.Drawing directly or create horrible previews with GetThumbnailImage. Add the ImageResizer.Plugins.DiskCache package to serve dynamic images as fast as static ones. 

With this library, you can create beautiful image galleries, product thumbnails, and fast, scalable websites *without* sacrificing agility or responsive web design.

## Functionality in this package

The ImageResizer core package lets you: 

1. Decode jpeg, png, gif, tiff, and bmp files from uploads, streams, byte arrays, and files. 

2. Pre-rotate or flip (based on gravity sensor OR manual angle).

3. Apply manual cropping in either source or screen coordinates.

4. Efficiently apply width and/or height constraints, using any of several constraint modes: max, pad, crop, or stretch. Provides the highest quality image resampling (bicubic 2-pass) available on the windows platform.

5. Rotate, flip, add borders, padding, margins, with custom colors.

3. Re-compress into jpeg (with adjustable compression) or lossless png form -  as a byte array, stream, or file.

All through a REST API and Managed API with a symmetrical command set. 

URL rewriting, custom authorization, 404 fallbacks, gradient generation, exif stripping, size limiting, and cache-control customization are also included in the core DLL.
