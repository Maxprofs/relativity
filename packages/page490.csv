Jeffrey Stedfast,2014-05-08T00:52:09.667Z,"MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME messages. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox files.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and about 75x faster than SharpMimeTools).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.

Jeffrey Stedfast,2014-05-08T00:53:00.413Z,"MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME, S/MIME and PGP messages on desktop and mobile platforms. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox files.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and about 75x faster than SharpMimeTools).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.

Ryan C. Gordon and others,2014-05-07T16:16:46.307Z,"PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. It is

		The programmer defines a write directory on the physical filesystem. No file writing done through
		the PhysicsFS API can leave that write directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting
		language cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its I/O, which means that
		untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links can be disabled as well, for added safety.
		For file reading, the programmer lists directories and archives that form a search path. Once
		the search path is defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. This makes
		for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on the disk, and it
		makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override a previous archive on a per-file basis.
		Finally, PhysicsFS gives you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, etc.",physfs,False,1899-12-31T16:00:00-08:00,False,False,PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives.,"CoApp,native,io,filesystem,physfs,physicsfs,nativepackage",-1,False,2.0.3
