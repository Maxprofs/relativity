The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

Usage:

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Common Questions:

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

Usage:

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-16T15:19:25.563Z,549,643,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

The coming sample XAML project will give an example of how to implement via bindings.

Usage:
    xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Common Questions:
 Q: Why is the pcl named "".Portable""?
 A: There is a .NETStandardv1.4 version ready to go, I am just waiting to see what happens with ""project.json"".

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?
 A: You can have all the profits made from this component. So, no Tim, you don't.

 Q: Would you like another coffee?
 A: Don't ask, give.

Rox Software Pty Ltd,2016-07-17T14:48:16.33Z,549,642,"View videos in Xamarin Forms with the VideoView control. Supports Android, iOS, and UWP only.

The VideoView control in its simplest form can be used with the built-in controller. The VideoView control can also be bound to your own custom controller. It is not currently recommended that both the built-in controller and a custom controller are used at the same time.

The VideoView control is now ready to be used with ShowController set to True and a valid URI VideoSource. The external bindings are ready for UWP only.

Usage:
    xmlns:roxv=""clr-namespace:Rox;assembly=Rox.Xamarin.Video.Portable""

    <roxv:VideoView AutoPlay=""True"" LoopPlay=""True"" ShowController=""True"" VideoSource=""http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4"" />

The VideoView has the following methods:
 - Task Start(); (Start playing the video)
 - Task Pause(); (Pause and Resume playing of video)
 - Task Stop(); (Stop playing the video)

The VideoView has the following bindable properties:
 - bool AutoPlay { get; set; } (Automatically starts playing the video, when video has finished loading)
 - bool LoopPlay { get; set; } (Start playing the video again from the start, once it has finished)
 - bool Muted { get; set; } (Mutes the volume)
 - bool ShowController { get; set; } (Determines if the built-in controller is visible)
 - VideoStateType VideoState { get; } (Empty, Error, Buffering, Playing, Paused, Stopped)
 - string VideoSource { get; set; } (Must be a valid URI)
 - double Volume { get; set; } (The sound level of the audio, from 0 to 1)

Common Questions:
 Q: Why is the pcl named "".Portable""?
 A: There is a .NETStandardv1.4 version ready to go, I am just waiting to see what happens with ""project.json"".

 Q: Do I get paid cos you used a picture of my dog?
 A: You can have all the profits made from this component. So, no Tim, you don't.

 Q: Would you like another coffee?
 A: Don't ask, give.

What people are saying about the VideoView control:
 - ""It is awesome"" - me
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about"" - random guy on the street
 - ""I wanna punch that rabbit in the head"" - my brother
 - ""That's nice, dear"" - my mum
 - ""It's better than Lego™"" - me
 - ""But I can already watch p0rn on my phone"" - name withheld (see I didn't tell them your name, Gav)
 - ""I don't know what you're talking about, and NO! I do not want to go back to your place and make our own video, creep."" - random girl on the street
 - ""I am pretty sure this will revolutionise the IT industry"" - me
 - ""If you don't shut up I will punch YOU in the head"" - my brother

Jeffrey Stedfast,2016-07-17T12:05:34.137Z,6,642,"MimeKit is an Open Source library for creating and parsing MIME, S/MIME and PGP messages on desktop and mobile platforms. It also supports parsing of Unix mbox files.

Unlike any other .NET MIME parser, MimeKit's parser does not need to parse string input nor does it use a TextReader. Instead, it parses raw byte streams, thus allowing it to better support undeclared 8bit text in headers as well as message bodies. It also means that MimeKit's parser is significantly faster than other .NET MIME parsers (more than 25x faster than OpenPOP.NET and over 100x faster than AE.Net.Mail and MailSystem.NET).

MimeKit's parser also uses a real tokenizer when parsing the headers rather than regex or string.Split() like most other .NET MIME parsers. This means that MimeKit is much more RFC-compliant than any other .NET MIME parser out there, including the commercial implementations.

In addition to having a far superior parser implementation, MimeKit's object tree is not a derivative of System.Net.Mail objects and thus does not suffer from System.Net.Mail's massive limitations or bugs.
