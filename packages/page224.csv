The C++ REST SDK (codename ""Casablanca"") is a project to start exploring how to best support C++ developers who want to take advantage of the radical shift in software architecture that cloud computing represents.

This library also gives you a convenient model for composing asynchronous operations. Whether your application is compute-intensive or I/O-driven,  its scalability is likely to require careful resource utilization. Asynchronous APIs are great for scalability,  but can be very hard to use when all you have is C-level functionality. Fortunately,  C++ 11 offers a whole new set of capabilities that can make dealing with asynchronous operations easy,  and the library takes advantage of that throughout.",cpprestsdk,False,2016-11-03T14:46:46.303-07:00,True,False,Casablanca is your toolbox for accessing and authoring connected applications using modern C++ features and best practices.,"REST,native,CoApp",85349,False,0.6.0.16

Microsoft Corporation,2013-04-24T19:28:17.103Z,"This library is a Microsoft effort to support cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design.

The C++ REST SDK (codename ""Casablanca"") is a project to start exploring how to best support C++ developers who want to take advantage of the radical shift in software architecture that cloud computing represents.

This library also gives you a convenient model for composing asynchronous operations. Whether your application is compute-intensive or I/O-driven,  its scalability is likely to require careful resource utilization. Asynchronous APIs are great for scalability,  but can be very hard to use when all you have is C-level functionality. Fortunately,  C++ 11 offers a whole new set of capabilities that can make dealing with asynchronous operations easy,  and the library takes advantage of that throughout.",cpprestsdk,False,2016-11-03T14:46:46.303-07:00,True,False,Casablanca is your toolbox for accessing and authoring connected applications using modern C++ features and best practices.,"REST,native,CoApp",85349,False,0.6.0.15
