.  Single file reference needed.
.  Full object hierarchy CRUD support. Saves all object properties and the relationships to related tables. Also supports collection properties.
.  Allows developers to write sql as needed for reads. The design just maps the results to the objects. Writes are tightly coupled to the database and build on primary key constraints.
