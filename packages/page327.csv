Alexander Paskhin/ paskhin@hotmail.co.uk,2013-10-08T23:17:51.873Z,"MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. Without using this pattern it is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. The most important features are to solve the “clear” separation tasks between View (the XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and ViewModel. 
Digital agencies are very often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development by two companies’ one application. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model. 
Here we have got a task when two different languages XAML and C# contracted together delivered by different companies. 
This project provides the transparent and professional package for developing quality UX design solutions. Without using these features or similar it is impossible to say that your XAML UX design has a quality. 
Well known Binding markup extension can bind only two properties together. The source property can be located either in Resources or either in code-behind. These standard framework features don’t allow developers to separate View from View Model. The volume of code behind development decrease quality of GUI, increase complicity and cost of maintainability. Change in View can cause the dramatic change of the code behind layer.

Alexander Paskhin/ paskhin@hotmail.co.uk,2013-10-08T23:18:12.87Z,"MVVM pattern is widely used in developing of XAML-based GUI applications. Without using this pattern it is impossible to provide the quality UX design implementations. Quality of UX design directly depends on the techniques or features that used for implementing the MVVM pattern. The most important features are to solve the “clear” separation tasks between View (the XAML code coupled with its code-behind) and ViewModel. 
Digital agencies are very often involved in providing the quality UX design solutions for application products. This process is based on separated development by two companies’ one application. Design agency develops View (XAML) part and Technology or Business Company concentrates on developing functional parts: View Model and Model. 
Here we have got a task when two different languages XAML and C# contracted together delivered by different companies. 
This project provides the transparent and professional package for developing quality UX design solutions. Without using these features or similar it is impossible to say that your XAML UX design has a quality. 
Well known Binding markup extension can bind only two properties together. The source property can be located either in Resources or either in code-behind. These standard framework features don’t allow developers to separate View from View Model. The volume of code behind development decrease quality of GUI, increase complicity and cost of maintainability. Change in View can cause the dramatic change of the code behind layer.

		For advanced scenarios, you can take advantage of each platform's capabilities by wrapping your common UI in a larger application, or even create your own high-level controls with a custom implementations per platform.

		This framework currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac/Xamarin.Mac, and GTK#.
		
		In order to run your Eto.Forms based application, you must also install one (or all) of the following packages:
		
		- Eto.Platform.Wpf
